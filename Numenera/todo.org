:END:
** STARTED Need several potential scenarios & encounters [0/29]
*** STARTED in town scenario 1 (ghoka)
  someone has stolen supplies from the warehouse. the sheriff thinks it was one
of ghoka's men. he's got a lot of things on his plate, so if someone can
investigate and either find the stolen goods or find evidence of who stole
them.

  a box of amber crystal was taken. these are crystals that are used in
self-repair numenera, or in numenera that float.

**** TODO design mystery [0%]
***** TODO who stole the amber crystal [0/3]
clues:
- [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ]
***** TODO where did they go
***** TODO why did they steal
***** TODO design ruin of where they're hiding
***** TODO don't forget, lots of cluuuuuuuues
- if players get stuck, have thief try to bribe them ( or ambush them )
*** STARTED in town scenario 2 (wright)
the wright needs iotum to build some healing numenera to help some homesteading
families that are sick. unfortunately, they're completely out of the ones they
need to complete their project.

they've heard rumors of a ruin in the area that may have the materials they
require; the rumors she heard described some symbols she's seen before on
healing numenera

if someone can retrieve the iotum and bring them to the wright, there will
probably be some leftover healing cyphers they can give out

**** TODO build map of ruin

**** TODO place ruin on map

**** TODO creature encounter
pick a creature that would make sense to have made its lair in the entrance to
the ruin, preferably a pack

*** STARTED in town scenario 3 (pamki)
  pamki needs someone to go into the ship and fix the water supply. either fix
  whatever broke and is fouling the water, or stop the water completely -- the
  poison is getting into the ground water table and causing issues for nearby
  farms.
  
**** TODO build the ship "entrance hall"
the parts of the ship that are well known and fully explored

**** TODO build the part of the ship that contains the broken equipment
need:
- [ ] broken machine that's fouling the water
- [ ] the machine that produces or pumps the water

**** TODO the twist
- to get to the area of the ship they need to get to, there's a door they need
  to pass through that's protected by a strong force field. a holographic
  assistant will inform them that secure areas of the ship are off limits to
  passengers, and that they should inform the steward if they feel there is an
  issue
  - alternate routes?
  - use the ring to turn off the force field ( same ring that opens the ship,
    pamki has it, if they get the ring then have them meet the ship AI )

*** STARTED in town scenario 4 (pamki)
someone has stolen some old numenera and some personal items that belonged to
ager. pamki needs someone to find out who stole them and return the numenera.

while pamki is normally somewhat shy and quiet, she becomes angry and animated
when talking about this. whatever was stolen was important.

**** TODO what was stolen
- the numenera:
  - 
  - 
  - 
- the personal items pamki actually cares about:
  - a still image of her parents and her, taken before her mom got sick
  - one of her father's journals
**** TODO who stole it
**** TODO where they are now
*** STARTED near town scenario 1 (sherif)
- the sheriff knows that ghoka has found somewhere else to set up camp. sheriff
  is worried that it's a ruin where ghoka will find something that will give him
  a deadly edge against the town.

  he's heard rumours about where the ruin is.

  what the sheriff knows:
  - when ghoka leaves he's going south, but could be doubling back
  - rumor: that ruin ghoka is using has a secret entrance
  - rumor: ghoka keeps something in the ruin that he uses to punish gang members
    that step out of line
     
  ghoka is smart, the ruin is actually to the west.

  ghoka keeps a xacorocax inside the ruin, in a pit. he throws gang members that
  fail him into the pit, if they can survive for ten minutes a rope is thrown in
  ( they still have to manage to climb out on their own, though )

  when the players reach the room with the pit, they'll see Leverett Stamper
  getting pushed into the pit and dying to the xacorocax. he'll show up in town
  a month later

**** TODO build map of ruin

*** STARTED near town scenario 2 (wood worker)
- there's a small forest near the town, only a few acres, but it'll provide
  enough wood to keep the woodworker in enough wood for the next few projects
  he's got planned.

  however, the second to last person he sent to scout the wood came back
  claiming there were demons. the last person he sent didn't make it back.

  he needs someone to either make those woods safe, or to find him another acre
  of woods. he'd prefer this forest, the trees there have particularly hard and
  strong wood.

**** TODO design forest ( design it like a ruin )

**** TODO pick a creature
- if it's dangerous, it killed the last person that came exploring
- if it's not, they died to a stupid accident

*** STARTED far from town scenario 1 (pamki)
  word has reached pamki that a caravan bringing food & building materials
has gotten lost somewhere between the city of the dead and ararholm.

  pamki would like someone to go and find the caravan and guide it to
ararholm. while they need the food and materials, she's mostly concerned about
the caravan -- the trader is an old friend of hers, and she wants to make sure
they're safe.

**** TODO figure out where the caravan is
**** TODO figure out how many are still alive
**** TODO create map of ruin that they're sheltering in
**** TODO figure out what needs to happen for the wagons to make it back to ararholm

** TODO Finish populating town with major NPCs [103/119]
