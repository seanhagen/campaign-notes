801: a daughter is born to tashi and ager, she is named Pamki -- which according to Tashi means "beautiful flower"

802: ager continues to spend time wandering the world, although he spends less time on the roads. drawn back home to his
family, some wonder if the days of ager walking the wilds is coming to an end 

805: Tashi dies of a wasting disease, leaving Ager heartbroken. he is despondant, and shuts himself away in his rooms
for several months.

806: when ager finally ventures out into the world again, he is a changed man. while most only see the same charming and
carefree man he was before the death of his wife, those closer to him know that the sense of joy and wonder he carried
with him is gone, or at least hidden deep within. the only time he seems to be truly happy is the weeks after returning
home and is reuinted with pamki again.

809: an accident caused by mistaken identity and/or old grudges causes an accident within the ship, causing a section
of the platau ararholm sits upon to collapse. luckily there were no homes there. additionally, some portion of the
spring that lay beneath ararholm finds its way through the cracks and begins to fills the collapsed portion with water.
something in the collapsed section of the plateau warms the water and changes the properties of the water. it is no
longer safe to drink, but laying within the waters heals minor injuries and is found to be very relaxing. despite the
beneficial outcome of the accident, ager puts limits on how many people are allowed to enter the ship at one time. his
hope is that with fewer people in the ship at once, there will be fewer chances for such accidents to happen again in
the future.

811: as people begin to come to ararholm in greater numbers as the fear of the mists receeds, ager is worried about the
make-up of the people who come to town. most are explorers and adventurers, who only come to explore the ship or the
surrounding ruins before leaving ( or perhaps dying, all that's known is that they're not seen again ). there are some
that come from calda with their families but most of these start farms. ager worries that the balance of power is
tipping towards the "horde of unwashed drit-grubbers", as he calls the growing group of adventurers camped outside
the city.

815: pamki comes of age, and ager begins instructing her on the ship. he also begins teaching her about the numenera he's collected, and tries to impart the wisdom he'd gathered over the years to his daughter.
