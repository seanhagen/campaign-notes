- Kashin Baya
 mountains that form a nearly impassable wall from the ocean to thousands of
 kilometers inland

 they form the northern edge of the Sable Hegemony's holdings

- Obsi Takobin
 mountains further north, somehow bigger and more impassable than the Kashin
 Baya

 these mountains are unnatural. where the Kashin Baya could have been formed by
 the geology of two continents colliding, the Obsi Takobin is wholly
 unnatural. they seem to be great shards of obisidian that has only been
 slightly worn down by the ages. nothing grows on them. traversing them is
 deadly: the ground is sharp enough to cut through most materials, so walking or
 climbing them is out unless you _want_ to slowly be sliced to ribbons starting
 with your hands and feet. if you do find some way to protect yourself, the
 mountains have other surprises in store. valleys and passes form strange
 labyrinths that confuse even the most experienced navigators and explorers. and
 this is a labyrinth populated by monsters; even if dangerous things didn't get
 trapped in the maze of valleys, the ground itself sometimes seems to be
 alive. piles of obisidian -- that anywhere else would be the offcuts of someone
 making knives or axes from the stone -- turn out to be snake-like creatures
 that spit shards of stone hard enough to pierce metal. nobody has yet found a
 path through the Obsi Takobin, and some legends of the Mutanen say that if
 someone does it'll trigger the end of the world, because the Obsi Takobin are
 actually the walls of a prison for something that must never be set free.

- Sudboia
  originally the rocky desert that was the home of the Mutanen, now the name of
  their kingdom -- although most refer to it as the Voz Dynasty 

- Voz Dynasty
  - ruler: Burkham Khaan, God of Khans, Eternal Warrior 
  - people: Mutanen
    - coming of age: go into the mountains and come back with something
      dangerous. some choose to go into the Kashin Baya, and come back with a
      numenera or two. the terrifying ones choose to venture into Obsi Takobin
      as their revered first khan did. those that survive usually become
      warriors and join the Ruwan Dare or "Night Blade", an absolutely terrifying
      group of warriors.
    - "Masu Kariya", a sort of priesthood / order of hermits, who function as a
      mix of priests, inquisitors, doctors, shamans, civil administrators, and
      lower court judges. they are people who were taken from their families as
      children and forced to learn the byzantine set of laws and taboos that
      keep the hard and harsh people of the Voz Dynasty together as a
      civilization. their two most important functions are indoctrinating the
      young so they focus what anger and resentment they have into becoming
      warriors ( ie, point the dangerous ones at our enemies ), and ensuring
      that numenera are kept under strict control of the Khanagate -- the ruling
      council of the Mutanen
  
  - theme: Mongols led by Ghengis Khan for the most part, mix in some other things too
  - outlook: the strong survive, and provide meaning to the weak
    - not the savage killers they're made out to be by the Sable Dynasty,
    - they're a tough people shaped by a ruthless land
    - they could have all moved out into the plains and become nomads if not for
      an insult given to a chief in the past that caused them to invade the
  - kingdom that bordered the praire and the hills at the eastern end of the
  - army: Takobin Shuga, Sword of the Emperor



- Sable Hegemony
  - people: Caldanians
  - army: Ebony Legion
