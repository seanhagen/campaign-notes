Before the war, the region was mostly grasslands and scattered forests. Home to nearly fifty thousand people, spread through five large cities and sixty smaller towns. The area was once a breadbasket to the rest of Calda, with the ground being much easier to farm than the stonier ground of Calda. The three major cities were part of the Singhan Root system, allowing travel from the eastern border all the way to the western ocean within a day or two.
