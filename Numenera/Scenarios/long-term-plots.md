Long Term Plots
===============

There are three main types of quests/adventures for those in Ararholm.

1. Safety & Security 
2. Resources 
3. Exploration 

## Safety & Security 

These are quests that help make Ararholm safer. Some may involve chasing off a
monster or a demon or two. Others might require finding a way to deal with a
gang of bandits. As the town grows, it should improve its defenses -- and there
are many ways to make a village secure in the Ninth World.

## Resources 

The village is slowly running out of resources. In the case of water, they've
reached the limit of what they're easily able to access. In addition to securing
good sources of food & water, there are materials to consider as well. Stone,
wood, and synth are needed for building new structures. Iotum and other
resources are needed by the wright to do their job.


## Exploration 

While Ararholm sits on top of a mesa with a good view of the surrounding area,
they don't really know what's out there in the region. 

Maps need to be made, dangers need to be found and dealt with, travel routes
need to be established. Ararholm is potentially only the first settlement in the
area, if there are other places that could be made safe and settled then
Ararholm's chances of survival go up.

# Plot Ideas

## In Town

Pamki/Sheriff:

- want to deal with Ghota and his gang 
- need to either fix what broke inside the ship so they have water or find some
  other source 
- would like to improve their defenses, but that's a lower priority  

Wright:

- needs materials, knows rumours about nearby ruins
  - has exact location for a couple of ruins 
  - has vague locations for a handful 
  - knows rumours about more

Mason:

- needs another source of stone, the one they've been using so far won't last
  too much longer 
  
Woodworker:

- needs someone to scout out some nearby forests to see if they are either safe,
  or can easily be made safe
  
Aeon Priest:

- would be willing to pay someone to go into the ship to see if there are
  components he can use

## Nearby 

Sheriff:
- several ruins need to be scouted and declared safe ( or ensure they're not
  being used by Ghota and his gang as a hideout )
- a diplomat has been sent by the Sable Hegemony, someone needs to go to the
  City of the Dead and guide them to Ararholm   

Pamki: 
- need better maps of the area, willing to pay for information about the hills
  and what lay beyond them

## Regional 

- rumors of a forest of giant mushrooms to the west
- rumors of a forest of red trees to the west 

## Calda 

Diplomat (once they arrive):
- willing to pay for information about land that would make good land for
  farming (Calda needs somewhere it can use to replace the farmland lost in the
  Undying War)
- a very big bounty is posted for any information about the Voz Dynasty
  - if they've been spotted, where and when and how many 
  - if someone is willing to scout out where they might be entering into
    Maka-Tho, that person or persons would get a title for sure 

eventually: 

Army Company:
sent to the region by the Queen as a way to say "you're part of the Hegemony,
don't forget it" 
- causes issues in town trying to impose their own rule & order on the place

## Sable Hegemony 

- any information about alternate routes through the Kashin Baya mountains will
  be well rewarded

## Voz Dynasty 

mostly busy with their own invaders, but are expanding into Maka-Tho
