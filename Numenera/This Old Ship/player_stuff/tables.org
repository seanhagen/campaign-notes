* Journals
Deciphering a journal requires a successful Intellect task. The difficulty is
based on the journal, see the table below for more information.

Ager has been around a long time, and knows how to write in codes that are truly
hard for machines to decipher. Cyphers, artifacts, or other numenera that
normally aid in deciphering code do not grant any additional assets or ease the
task in any way.

However, skills related to any of the following can aid in the task: decoding,
cryptography, finding hidden things, perception, languages, and performance.

 - Deciphering every journal from I to L grants an asset when deciphering other
   journals. Deciphering every journal from LI to LXXV grants an additional asset.
 - Journal 100 (C) can only be deciphered once every other Journal has been
   deciphered.
