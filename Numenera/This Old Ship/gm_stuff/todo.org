* NPCs
** Innkeep (Lowen Hob)
has a very deep voice, almost makes your bones rumble

can fight, but prefers to use some numenera he's picked up over the years to
stop fights in his tavern

** Mason (Sech Nokham)
a bit arrogant about his skills, has a bit of a friendly/unfriendly rivalry with
mex about who's the better craftsperson ( he thinks she doesn't create things
with any "art or soul", she thinks his designs are almost so artistic they lose
functionality )
