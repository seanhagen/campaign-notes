  - Keeps her hands close to her face, often touch her cheeks, nibbling on a
    fingernail, or rubbing her forehead. Fidgets when she's in a situation where
    she should try to keep her hands away from her face.
  - speaks quietly
  - will always put her wife first, no matter what
  - very empathetic, cares deeply about the town and everyone in it

**** Key Info
 - can barely fight, knows some low-level esoteries, mostly relies on cyphers
   
**** Appearance
Long dark brown hair, kept in lose braids. Some of the braids have metal or bone
beads, most are capped by a larger bead. Her face leans more towards "handsome"
than "pretty", although she is by no means ugly.

Tends to dress in loose clothing that she can be comfortable in regardless of
where the day takes her. Blacks, reds, and greens tend to be her preferred
colours, although she prefer paler shades of red & green to vibrant or dark
shades.

Carries herself with a grace not often seen by those who are not bards & dancers
by trade.

**** Background
Born to Ager and Tashi, Pamki has grown up into a wise young woman. Often feels
like she's way out of her depth, but knows she can rely on her wife and the rest
of the town to help deal with the challenges of building a town out past the
frontier. Most people in town call her by the honorific Capu; it means something
akin to "Honorary Mayor".

**** Key Info
 - Firecly loyal to Pamki and a handful of other folks in Ararholm
 - Still drinks like she isn't missing an arm and a leg.
 - Is very careful about hygine, as the the connection points for her arm and
   leg can get infected if she's not careful about keeping them cleaned and
   oiled.
   
**** Appearance
 - green eyes
 - 5'8" tall
 - pale skin
 - bright red hair with a streak of pure white on her left side
 - heavily scarred face ( missing left eye )

Has a slight build that hides a wiry strength, her robotic limbs give her a
slightly unbalanced apperance when she wears them.  Her robotic limbs, which
seem to be made of a ceramic substance that is very hard to damage.

**** Background
A glaive who nearly died in a deadly ruin, but was transformed into something
more and less than human.

When a numenera being worked on by a friend detonated, Birgitte nearly lost her
life. Her friend, though obliterated by the explosion, managed to shield
Birgitte from the worst of the blast. Birgitte lost most of the left side of her
body -- it took her left arm and leg, took a chunk from her torso, and heavily
scarred her face and head. The team she was delving with managed to save her
life through a combination of healing skill, some handy cyphers, and a great
deal of luck. They placed her in a numenera they had found earlier that seemed
to be some kind of full-body repair device.

Unfortunately, they didn't know that it was configured for a non-human
design. Thankfully, the process rebuilt her with mechanical parts rather than
potentially incompatible biological ones. Now her left leg and arm are powerful
mechanical limbs, although she lost the use of her left eye. These parts are not
bonded perfectly with her body, however.

When connected, the arm and leg function perfectly but put Birgitte in constant
pain. It's not enough to be debilitating, but it is not a pleasant
experience. Unless she really needs to, Birgitte spends most of her time these
days with the arm and leg disconnected. She uses a crutch to get around, and
lives a happy and fulfilling life with Pamki in Ararholm.

**** Background
Learned most of his fighting style on the back streets of Qi. Picked up some
tricks from glaives he travelled with when he was younger.

Joined Ager's trade company as a glaive to guard caravans. Worked his way up to
become a trusted friend of Ager and head of security for the company. Came with
Ager to settle Ararholm. The head of security for the trade company, he now
serves as the sheriff for Ararholm.

Wants Ararholm to grow so that he can hire people to do the annoying work so he
can sit in an office and get fat from sugary treats.

Failed to protect Pamki when she was younger, is a bit resentful that Fox saved
her ( more resentful that Fox is kind of a constant reminder of one of his
bigger failures, not really that resentful towards either of them ).

A long gun that uses a reservoir of a silvery material as ammo. It

The tattoos Lady Gol has on her arms are more than just decoration: they help
her focus and manipulate gravitational energy to a certain degree.

On her turn, she can choose to do one of the following:
 - slam her fists into the ground, unleashing a crescent-shaped wave of energy
   that races out in an arc of Lady Gol's choosing; it can topple even the
   largest of foes ( Intellect defense at level 7 to avoid falling prone )
 - focus her power into an incredible leap, can jump incredible distances. most
   often uses this as a charge attack, which does 8 points of damage to the
   target and 2 to Lady Gol; additionally the target must succeed at a level 8
   Might task or be knocked back 15 meters
 - spend a turn focusing her energy into her fists, which lets her bypass armor
   with her next attack. additionally, if hit, target must make a level 5 might
   save or risk getting hit for an additional 6 points of crushing damage
 - focus her power on the area within immediate range creating highly increased
   gravity, creatures must make a level 4 might check to move at all, failure
   results in falling to the ground prone and taking 2 points of damage;
   creature must make the same might save every turn or take another 2 points of
   damage, success allows the creature to move at half speed within immediate
   range of Lady Gol

retrofitted tank parts.

[[file:~/Documents/CampaignNotes/Numenera/This Old Ship/gm_stuff/assets/512b954133215bf5f55da6f35fe3768c.jpg]]

**** Background
Used to be a member of an elite commando squad in the Ukor Federation. When the
Federation was absorbed by the Sable Hegemony two decades ago, he chose to leave
that life behind and wandered the land looking for a purpose.

Met Lady Tirade when she was young and had run away from home. Protected her
from a ravage bear, with the aid of Lady Tirade's thuman. Because the thuman was
okay with Tigor, Lady Tirade ( only 6 at the time ) decided Tigor was okay. She
told them that if anybody had a problem with him they'd have to deal with
her. Tigor was so taken with her grit and determination, he accompanied her back
home.

When the pair arrived back in the city with the royal family's summer manor, the
pair made quite a sight: a large unknown humanoid, singing and laughing while
carrying the Daughter of Midnight, Holder of the Sable Shield,
fourth-in-line-to-the-throne Lady Gol Tirade on his shoulder -- who was laughing
and apparently having a grand time.

A few guards approached at this point, and offered to escort the princess home,
she said she was safer with Tigor than she was with him. Fearing that she had
been mind controlled or something akin to that, the guards attacked with the
intention of getting the princess away from this unknown creature.

Tigor quickly and effortlessly disarmed the guards without hurting them. He
plucked Lady Tirade from his shoulder and placed her on the ground, and told her
that he wouldn't want to approach her home and give her family the same idea the
guards had gotten. So he told her to go with the guards, and he would follow.

Once back at the family's summer manor, Lady Tirade explained the whole story to
her father and older sisters. They were quickly taken with Tigor's manner,
humility, and obvious concern for the safety of someone he had only just
met. Tigor was granted an audience to the Queen, so that she could determine
Tigor's worth and trustworthiness. Apparently he passed, and Tigor has been Lady
Tirade's guardian ever since.

His armor is almost purely defensive. It uses ancient technology to redirect or

 - when attacked with a melee attack defends as level 10, creatures who get a
   successful hit must pass a level 5 might save or lose their weapon -- weapons
   that are part of the creature are not affected
 - can switch places with anyone within short distance if they fail to dodge an
   attack

 - the dynasty seeks to take control of Maka Tho
 - her full name is Ibakha Togh Celi ( clan family personal, not personal family
   like we're used to )
***** Maka Tho
 - there is a route through Maka Tho to Sudboia
 - she needs to find it again
***** Personal
 - has never seen battle against other humans before
 - believes in what she was taught in a way that makes her believes incompatible
   with what the Dynasty wants to do

**** Appearance
 A woman of average height with raven hair and striking eyes. Her martial garb
 is offset by the bright and varied colours. Moves like a dancer, stands still
 like a stone.

**** Background
A lesser cousin of the Voz royal family, who has gotten incredibly lost trying
to find a route through Maka Tho from her homeland. Wasn't put in charge of the
expidition, but is the highest ranking officer left.

Has never before left her homeland; she didn't fight in the wars because she was
too young at the time. The trained harder than any in her class though, and has
a need to prove that she's not just another royal brat.

Arrived back in Maka Tho with ~10 people.

Took in all the lessons about honor, only fighting as a last resort ( but
fighting with everything you have ), and being a fair and equitable ruler --
which, combined with her somewhat sheltered upbringing has made her somewhat
incompatible with her father's plans. He's hoping that time in the army will
bring her around to his point of view. He was wronged by Ager in the past; Tashi
was meant to be next in line to rule and take on the mantle of the Stalwart
Protector.

 - base him a bit on Elijah Snow of Planetary; takes his time, gathers all the

 - at the time of his death, was 6134 years old
 - him and his gang found the nightmares and accidentally released them, spent
   the rest of their lives trying to put them back or kill them
 - "rest of their lives" turned out to be longer than they thought, as they were
   "cursed" by the tomb they found the nightmares in to live until the
   nightmares were returned or killed
 - the curse also functions as a fail safe: the curse is actually nanotechnology
   that keeps humans alive and sane, but will react to the touch ( or proxy
   touch via melee weapon, etc ) by attacking the nightmare and attempting to
   subdue it -- but this kills the human
 - that's what actually happened to ager, he wanted to shake things up and so

**** Background
  This is what's left of Savathun after ~1 billion years. As far as she knows
  she's the *only Hive left*, the only one still alive anywhere in the
  universe. The pyramid ships and the Traveller are long since dust.

  Now she's just a *lonely old woman* who refuses to die, partially still driven
  by the urge to *collect secrets* and tell lies and weave complex webs -- but
  honestly mostly just looking for company at this point. Everything she knew
  turned out to be false, including what the Light would do for her.

**** Background
Went through rampancy and was responsible for the accident that caused the ship
to end up where it is now. Knows she should feel something about that, but
because the memory cores containing those memories went offline ages ago she
can't remember. Not remembering parts of her own history causes her to feel
grief and anxiety; partially because she may have forgotten something important
about the ship, but also because she feels she can't atone until she remembers
what she did. She is also scared that gaining access to the memory cores on the
ship will change who she is -- her greatest fear is becoming a monster.

**** Stat Block
Doesn't have much she can do to affect the physical world beyond using
automatons.

*** Description
"Deceit" is one of the few nightmares with the ability to communicate with
people. But don't get me wrong. This cunning monster doesn't come to make
friends with you. Maybe you think you won't easily listen to a monster's
rhetoric, but the problem is that The hints it gives are often not necessarily
wrong . In this barren world, if you want to move forward, you must get some
information The information provided by "words" is sometimes crucial. Gradually,
people will rely on its rhetoric. But remember, a lie is a true predator. No
matter what help you get from it, one day it will take away the most important
thing from you and never come back ...

so what did the cunning monster "Deceit" take from us? That's the most important
thing we need to move forward in the whole world, that is, some kind of
"sight". One day, when the "Deceit" disappears, you will find that you can't see
anyone again. In the future journey, even if you are devastated, your regret,
your howling, Your anger can not be conveyed to anyone, you become lonely in the
real sense, no one will find you, you can not find anyone, your voice will only
reverberate empty in the wilderness, at that time, you will know what you have
lost, that is - "trust".

*** Key Info
 - currently targeting Zeno & Lady Gol Tirade
 - can only be defeated by someone who truly doesn't doubt themselves, who is
   fully confident in themselves and their abilities
 - this is because Doubt is actually incredibly weak physically, they make up
   for it with their incredibly psychic power.
 - if it can plant a "seed" of doubt in the mind of a target, it can turn that
   doubt into reality with enough time and concentration. it imbues that seed
   with energy over time, and once it reaches a critical threshold that doubt
   becomes true for the target. so if it is able to plant a doubt like "i'll
   never be able to hurt doubt" in your mind, with enough time and power it can
   make it so that you really *can't* hurt doubt (ager knows this)
 - will offer info on hate and anxiety if they think it'll get them out of a jam

A 9-foot tall creature, somewhere between a bat and a wolf.

A mantle of dark energy sits upon its shoulders, constantly spewing a dark smoke
into the air. It uses this smoke to confound and attack its foes.

*Level:* 6
*Health:* 50
*Damage Inflicted:* 3 points
*Armour:* 1
*Movement:* Long
*Modifications:* All attacks that target it or defense against it must
use Speed or are hindered by one level, Level 7 for deceiving and confusing

*Combat:*
Relies on misdirection and speed to attack from unexpected angles to hide the
fact it's a psychic projection.

As a pre-emptive move, attacks with a blast of psychic energy. Players must make
a Level 7 Intellect save or have all attacks against the avatar be hindered by
one level. The attack inflicts a crippling sense of doubt upon the character,
making every task harder to accomplish.

However, once make the save: all attacks against the avatar are eased by two
levels for the next two rounds, then go back to normal ( breaking the psychic
attack fills them with a sense of confidence that gives them an edge for a short
period of time ) -- normal being Level 6 difficulty.

Doubt will prioritize attacking those who have defeated the psychic attack.

Attacks do intellect damage, and bypass armor.

Will use a psychic spike on all creatures within range as its first act after
falling below 20 hit points. This does 4 points of intellect damage to every
creature it can see, and targets must make a level 5 intellect save or be
knocked unconscious as the spike scrambles their brain with pain. Uses this
distraction to escape, appearing to turn into smoke and disappear.

*** Description
"Doubt is the one sent to weaken defenses from within. Doubt can plant a seed in
your mind. Just a small thought, a tiny voice that speaks before you fall
asleep. Maybe we can't hurt them, or find them, or even survive. That doubt
grows, fed by both the target as they spiral and Doubt as they pour energy into
the seed of doubt. When that seed sprouts, it changes reality for the
target. Whatever they doubted is now true, for the target. Did the target doubt
they could hurt the Nightmares? Now they can't, no matter what they try. Doubt
tries to target the strongest, to remove key support from their enemies before
one of Doubt's duped allies attacks in force.

"Doubt" is a strange hunter. Its "hunting" is not so much a hunting as a funny
farce. It all stems from the slightest psychological fluctuation. Maybe you will
feel unnatural uneasiness one day, and the existence of "Doubt" will magnify
this uneasiness, which is quiet Looking at the poor traveler's mind getting
confused day by day from a high place, you can feel its existence, you know it
is somewhere, like you show that disgusting smile, you can feel, can imagine,
but can't see where it is, "Doubt" can start at any time, you are panicked and

"Vanity, for example, can turn almost anyone to their cause if they're able to

their power with them, because of course they're worthy of it. That power twists
their mind until they are nothing more than a puppet, a husk of their former
self.

in the dark night, please don't stay in the forest for a long time. Don't

an environment, people are easily attracted by the light. Yes, the light of
"Vanity" is a curse. It always makes you stop in the cold night and feel a

*** Description
There is no doubt that the power of "Despair" is absolutely fatal. It acts
elegantly and calmly. Every action seems to show its own strength and power to
everything around it. However, it seldom does it by itself. It just sits on the
empty throne all day long, constantly rummaging through the books engraved with
any words We all know that it can't be avoided. Sooner or later, "Despair" will
come to visit. Maybe, at that time, you were cheated by "Deceit" and lost
everything... Maybe you were trampled by "Scorn", and sank into the cold soil
with tears and dignity... Maybe you were surrounded by "Lonely", bruised and
bruised by wild animals and fell into a dead end... In that final vague
consciousness You can see that they are running away for some reason, but an
unknown figure comes to you with a calm pace. It holds a huge black sword of
exaggerated size with only one hand. The heavy pressure warns you that it is
some kind of vicious and vicious monster. It walks slowly to you crawling on the
ground. Its face clearly has no organs, but you feel it Feel that it is
overlooking you, it does not hurry, easy to hold up the hands of the dark sword,
record your last gasp, and then give you a real sense of unconsciousness, but
the most painful "death" ...

1. The terrible sword held by the deadly "despair" is not pure violence. People
   killed by despair will magnify their pain because of fear. The most terrible
   thing is that although most people will rejuvenate and usher in rebirth,
   "despair" is not the same. This huge sword will become heavier and heavier
   because of the fear of the victims, and being killed by "despair" will
   prolong the "death" time It is the fear of it. The more we recall the pain,
   the longer the "death" time will be. For people with limited time, it is
   undoubtedly an unreasonable and compulsory plunder of "life".
2. The book held by "despair" is said to be used to record people's tragic
   ending before death. We know that nightmares have no vision, but this book is
   actually used to record some kind of ending, but it is a kind of sound, which
   comes from the cry or gasp of people tearing their hearts and lungs when they
   are hurt and collapsed. Those voices turn into black unknown words and
   infiltrate into "Despair" ”In the book of , whenever the page is touched
   gently, the hoarse cry will linger in the ear like a whisper. It is very
   happy to enjoy this "tranquility" on the empty throne.
3. The most fatal point of "Despair" is not only the special death mechanism,
   but also the possibility that it can cause the real death which is no
   different from the reality and can not be reborn. The interest of "Despair"
   in recording the breath and roar of dying people in books is actually because
   it does not understand, it does not understand why people will resist death
   and fight against the established fate The attitude makes desperation feel
   very interesting. It is trying to understand something that the "Nightmare"
   does not have, but the weak creatures in front of them have. It is eager to
   get it, so it records it and constantly reviews it. However, there are also
   exceptions. "Despair" has encountered the situation that prey quietly accepts
   death. Those people often do not have any resistance to the coming death, and
   naturally they do not There will be any screams and gasps for "Despair" to
   appreciate. "Despair" thinks that this is boring. Although it will kill these
   walking corpses, they will not be reborn again. In a real sense, they end the
   journey, and take "Despair" as an excuse to end "life".

*** Description
"Scorn is their insidious assassin. Careful and methodical, they weave phantoms
and illusions. They twist the experiences of the target to twist and inflate their
pride. Joking words of encouragement become sarcastic jibes. An innocent cough becomes
twisted into the punchline of a sly joke at the targets expense. At the end of
this road lay death. The target lashes out at the wrong person and either gets
themselves killed; or should they succeed they are driven insane as Scorn strips
away the falsehoods to show that every perceived slight was actually an
expression of love and comradeship.

"Scorn" is a pure combative. It likes to fight and is almost paranoid in this
regard. Maybe it has no malice to you, but just for enjoying violence, "Scorn"
is willing to fight with you and pursue you to the ends of the world. The more
obvious your intention of resistance is, the higher the momentum of "Scorn" is,
and don't misunderstand it, This monster doesn't have the demeanor of a
soldier. It doesn't give a fatal blow to the loser. Instead, it continues to
trample and torture. With the simple imitation of human words and a slightly
unfamiliar "abuse", this monster looks down on the loser in front of him with a
proud posture until you are dying. Even the final dignity is deprived. It shows
the symbolic ugly Smile, but you've never felt before that any nightmare is so
suitable for this twisted smile.
