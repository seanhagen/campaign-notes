*** Background
  This is what's left of Savathun after ~1 billion years. As far as she knows
  she's the *only Hive left*, the only one still alive anywhere in the
  universe. The pyramid ships and the Traveller are long since dust.

  Now she's just a *lonely old woman* who refuses to die, partially still driven
  by the urge to *collect secrets* and tell lies and weave complex webs -- but
  honestly mostly just looking for company at this point. Everything she knew
  turned out to be false, including what the Light would do for her.

[[file:./assets/brigette.jpeg]]
*** Background
A glaive who nearly died in a deadly ruin, but was transformed into something
more and less than human.

When a numenera being worked on by a friend detonated, Birgitte nearly lost her
life. Her friend, though obliterated by the explosion, managed to shield
Birgitte from the worst of the blast. Birgitte lost most of the left side of her
body -- it took her left arm and leg, took a chunk from her torso, and heavily
scarred her face and head. The team she was delving with managed to save her
life through a combination of healing skill, some handy cyphers, and a great
deal of luck. They placed her in a numenera they had found earlier that seemed
to be some kind of full-body repair device.

Unfortunately, they didn't know that it was configured for a non-human
design. Thankfully, the process rebuilt her with mechanical parts rather than
potentially incompatible biological ones. Now her left leg and arm are powerful
mechanical limbs, although she lost the use of her left eye. These parts are not
bonded perfectly with her body, however.

When connected, the arm and leg function perfectly but put Birgitte in constant
pain. It's not enough to be debilitating, but it is not a pleasant
experience. Unless she really needs to, Birgitte spends most of her time these
days with the arm and leg disconnected. She uses a crutch to get around, and
lives a happy and fulfilling life with Pamki in Ararholm.

* Nightmares From Another Place And Time
** Deceit 
*** Image
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 400px
[[file:./assets/deceit.jpg]]
*** Description
"Deceit" is one of the few nightmares with the ability to communicate with
people. But don't get me wrong. This cunning monster doesn't come to make
friends with you. Maybe you think you won't easily listen to a monster's
rhetoric, but the problem is that The hints it gives are often not necessarily
wrong . In this barren world, if you want to move forward, you must get some
information The information provided by "words" is sometimes crucial. Gradually,
people will rely on its rhetoric. But remember, a lie is a true predator. No
matter what help you get from it, one day it will take away the most important
thing from you and never come back ...

so what did the cunning monster "Deceit" take from us? That's the most important
thing we need to move forward in the whole world, that is, some kind of
"sight". One day, when the "Deceit" disappears, you will find that you can't see
anyone again. In the future journey, even if you are devastated, your regret,
your howling, Your anger can not be conveyed to anyone, you become lonely in the
real sense, no one will find you, you can not find anyone, your voice will only
reverberate empty in the wilderness, at that time, you will know what you have
lost, that is - "trust".
** Doubt
*** Image
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 400px
[[file:./assets/doubt.jpg]
*** Description
"Doubt" is a strange hunter. Its "hunting" is not so much a hunting as a funny
farce. It all stems from the slightest psychological fluctuation. Maybe you will
feel unnatural uneasiness one day, and the existence of "Doubt" will magnify
this uneasiness, which is quiet Looking at the poor traveler's mind getting
confused day by day from a high place, you can feel its existence, you know it
is somewhere, like you show that disgusting smile, you can feel, can imagine,
but can't see where it is, "Doubt" can start at any time, you are panicked and
full of holes, but "Doubt" enjoys playing with prey, it is also As you think,
all the time to show you that disgusting smile.
** Hate
*** Image
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 400px
[[file:./assets/hate.jpg]
*** Description
If “Prejudice” is the kindling of war, then hatred is the reason for the
continuation of war... Under the shadow of the poor traveler's corpse, which has
lost its life, there are some things that have witnessed what happened. "Hate"
is like a butterfly, emerging from the shadow of the corpse, and the face is
twisted by its own pathetic host Face, it has been waiting for this moment for a
long time, the newborn is hungry, it urgently needs food, and food for "Hate" is
a new killing, so who is it? Maybe it's a nightmare, maybe another unfortunate
traveler, but it doesn't care, and even these crazy demons don't know. Whether
it's a nightmare or a traveler who dies through the "Hate" hand, there will be a
new "Hate" in the nightmare or in the traveler, waiting quietly for the moment
to break out of the cocoon...
** Vanity

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 400px
[[file:./assets/vanity.jpg]
*** Description
in the dark night, please don't stay in the forest for a long time. Don't
misunderstand it. The terrible thing is not just the depressed darkness. In such
an environment, people are easily attracted by the light. Yes, the light of
"Vanity" is a curse. It always makes you stop in the cold night and feel a
little warm and peaceful Heart, but don't be deceived by these luminous
butterflies. They are hounds and baits. Run quickly. This proves that "Lost" is
nearby. It will drag the poor travelers into the deep forest. Your howling will
be drowned by silence. The next day, there will be a beautiful and luminous
butterfly in the forest...
** Despair
*** Image
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 400px
[[file:./assets/despair.jpg]
*** Description
There is no doubt that the power of "Despair" is absolutely fatal. It acts
elegantly and calmly. Every action seems to show its own strength and power to
everything around it. However, it seldom does it by itself. It just sits on the
empty throne all day long, constantly rummaging through the books engraved with
any words We all know that it can't be avoided. Sooner or later, "Despair" will
come to visit. Maybe, at that time, you were cheated by "Deceit" and lost
everything... Maybe you were trampled by "Scorn", and sank into the cold soil
with tears and dignity... Maybe you were surrounded by "Lonely", bruised and
bruised by wild animals and fell into a dead end... In that final vague
consciousness You can see that they are running away for some reason, but an
unknown figure comes to you with a calm pace. It holds a huge black sword of
exaggerated size with only one hand. The heavy pressure warns you that it is
some kind of vicious and vicious monster. It walks slowly to you crawling on the
ground. Its face clearly has no organs, but you feel it Feel that it is
overlooking you, it does not hurry, easy to hold up the hands of the dark sword,
record your last gasp, and then give you a real sense of unconsciousness, but
the most painful "death" ...

1. The terrible sword held by the deadly "despair" is not pure violence. People
   killed by despair will magnify their pain because of fear. The most terrible
   thing is that although most people will rejuvenate and usher in rebirth,
   "despair" is not the same. This huge sword will become heavier and heavier
   because of the fear of the victims, and being killed by "despair" will
   prolong the "death" time It is the fear of it. The more we recall the pain,
   the longer the "death" time will be. For people with limited time, it is
   undoubtedly an unreasonable and compulsory plunder of "life".
2. The book held by "despair" is said to be used to record people's tragic
   ending before death. We know that nightmares have no vision, but this book is
   actually used to record some kind of ending, but it is a kind of sound, which
   comes from the cry or gasp of people tearing their hearts and lungs when they
   are hurt and collapsed. Those voices turn into black unknown words and
   infiltrate into "Despair" ”In the book of , whenever the page is touched
   gently, the hoarse cry will linger in the ear like a whisper. It is very
   happy to enjoy this "tranquility" on the empty throne.
3. The most fatal point of "Despair" is not only the special death mechanism,
   but also the possibility that it can cause the real death which is no
   different from the reality and can not be reborn. The interest of "Despair"
   in recording the breath and roar of dying people in books is actually because
   it does not understand, it does not understand why people will resist death
   and fight against the established fate The attitude makes desperation feel
   very interesting. It is trying to understand something that the "Nightmare"
   does not have, but the weak creatures in front of them have. It is eager to
   get it, so it records it and constantly reviews it. However, there are also
   exceptions. "Despair" has encountered the situation that prey quietly accepts
   death. Those people often do not have any resistance to the coming death, and
   naturally they do not There will be any screams and gasps for "Despair" to
   appreciate. "Despair" thinks that this is boring. Although it will kill these
   walking corpses, they will not be reborn again. In a real sense, they end the
   journey, and take "Despair" as an excuse to end "life".
** Scorn
*** Image
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 400px
[[file:./assets/scorn.jpg]]

*** Description
"Scorn" is a pure combative. It likes to fight and is almost paranoid in this
regard. Maybe it has no malice to you, but just for enjoying violence, "Scorn"
is willing to fight with you and pursue you to the ends of the world. The more
obvious your intention of resistance is, the higher the momentum of "Scorn" is,
and don't misunderstand it, This monster doesn't have the demeanor of a
soldier. It doesn't give a fatal blow to the loser. Instead, it continues to
trample and torture. With the simple imitation of human words and a slightly
unfamiliar "abuse", this monster looks down on the loser in front of him with a
proud posture until you are dying. Even the final dignity is deprived. It shows
the symbolic ugly Smile, but you've never felt before that any nightmare is so
suitable for this twisted smile.
** Anxiety
*** Image
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 400px
[[file:./assets/anxiety.jpg]]

*** Description
It's a pity that when we find out "Anxiety", it's too late. There are few rumors
about them. Their news usually comes from some weird and irreparable tragedy. So
it's hard to know what they look like, what their purpose is and where they
live. But there are all kinds of tragedies that evaporate in the world One
common feature - broken mirrors, but... Anyway, I think you can more or less
feel that they are growing in size, whether they belong to a nightmare world or
a reality, they have always been ...
** Absurdity
*** Image
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 400px
[[file:./assets/absurdness.jpg]]
*** Description
The existence of "Absurdness" is very old, and the legend about him is very
strange. It often tells a bizarre tragedy, a ridiculous sacrifice, or a war with
a ridiculous cause, but no matter what According to the legend, the description
of it is very vague. People only know where the "Absurdness" appears, where
there will be strange disasters. People accuse it of its existence, claim that
it is tempted by demons, and think it will cause disasters, and enjoy it. , But
there are different opinions on how it does it and how it tempts people. No one
knows how the truth is. Maybe people are right. It is indeed a despicable
demon. It escapes from hell to the world in order to play with the human heart,
but more terrible things are often people. A guilty conscience, maybe it is just
an "audience", it did nothing, did not interfere, just a "audience" enjoying the
funny performance...

From a certain day, the "audience" suddenly turned into beasts, rushing to the
stage and starting to fight each other, while the "clowns" were forced to come
to the audience and watch the funny performance quietly, until people regained
their sanity and they stood In the pool of blood, at a loss, suddenly people
turned to accuse him, saying that he was tempted by the devil, and prayed for
forgiveness from the gods, he laughed, and for the first time in his life he
felt such a strong pleasure, crazy The laughter was submerged by accusations,
echoing in the empty hall, no one knew...——a diary diary
