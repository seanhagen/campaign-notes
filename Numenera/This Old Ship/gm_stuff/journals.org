* Ager's Journals
Ager spent a lot of time writing things down; not only that, he wrote in a
number of various codes and ciphers. His encrypted journals are hard to
decipher, even Fellwinter struggles.

It's worth the effort though, as Ager hid numerous clues, hints, and tips within
his journals -- as well as the outline of his plan to defeat the Nightmares. He
even has notes on the ruins he visited, although he didn't leave clear
directions on how to get back to them.

Each journal covers a specific topic; some detail a specific ruin, with detailed
notes on what he saw, felt, smelled, or otherwise experienced. Others deal with
specific people, towns, creatures, or a variety of other topics.

The topics are split up into groups:
 - Numenera Plan Seeds
 - Plans For The Nightmares
 - Creatures & People
 - "Stories"

Each group has a varying number of journals, but each journal will provide the
party with /something/. It might be just a location for a potential cache or
hideout, or a cypher plan, or just something neat -- but every journal will
provide some kind of actionable information.

The next few sections will detail the topic groups, and what kind of information
can be found within those journals.

** Numenera Plan Seeds

:END:
These journals tend to be more like archaeology field notes than journal
entries. Each journal details a ruin, or part of a ruin. Some deal with portions
of the buried ship.

The difficulty of deciphering each journal depends on how valuable Ager thought
that particular ruin or plan seed could be.
