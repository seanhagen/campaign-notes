** Combat Tracker
things I need to know:
- what round is it
- whose turn is it
- creature name
- creature level (should auto-fill hp & initiative, but allow me to change)
- initiative
- current & max hp
- armor value
- movement speed
- statuses

other things i need to track:
- is creature a swarm/horde/group (and how many in group)
- link or something to creature stats, so i can reference attacks and whatnot

nice to haves:
- combat log ( who hit who for how much damage, & maybe ask for comment after each turn )
- command to apply status, with optional turn counter for how long the status
  will last ( if it goes away after a certain number of turns/minutes/etc )
- skip creature's turn if certain statuses are set ( stunned, etc )


example:
=======================================================
Round of combat: 1
| Turn | Creature     | Initiative | HP | DT | A | Mvmt | Status      |
| >>>> | thief (4)    |    12      | 15 | 0  | 0 |  S   |             |
|      |  bob (PC)    |    14      | x  | 0  | 2 |  S   |             |
|      | ratdog (2|4) |    18      | 5  | 0  | 2 |  S   | group(6,30) |
|      |  stacy (PC)  |    20      | x  | 0  | 1 |  S   | dazed(1)    |

Log:
 - thief hit bob for 4 points of damage

=======================================================

notes:

- creatures like so:
# ratdog (2|4)
are showing their base level (2) and the level of the group/swarm (4)
- the "group (6,30)" status marks that creature as a group, and shows how many
  creatures there are, as well as the health of the group
- when damage is taken, the "group(6,30)" should get updated as appropriate;
  for example if it takes 6 points of damage it should read "group(5,24)" as
  it's taken enough damage to kill one of the creatures in the swarm
- once a group is down to a final creature, the "group" status should be removed
- the "dazed(1)" status shows that this creature is afflicted by that status,
  and the status will get removed after that creature's turn ( when their turn
  is over, the number gets decremented, and hits 0, so the status gets removed )

**** Ruin
Take a few tries of doing a ruin using just the cards; improv this one

General descriptions:
 - Tron, but with red & orange only, no blue or white
 - Gravity is always where your soles are pointing, making space traversal
   tricky; moving in combat is always a difficulty 3 speed task, jumping is a
   difficulty 5 speed task, any fancy moves or acrobatics are hindered two levels
 - doors are glowing orange portals, some are one-way
 - the first few rooms should be rooms, after that they emerge into a immense
   open space, way larger than what should fit inside the monolith; after this
   point they're on platforms in the air that are connected by cables and
   walkways. there are no guard rails, but platforms usually have an assortment
   of walls ( chest-high and otherwise ), or building facades -- like it's a
   training ground for an army

last fight is with the Avatar of Doubt.

ruins have no connection to the nightmares or anything else, it's just an
extra-dimensional space that Doubt found, and then used to spring a trap.

**** What Does The Intevention Of The Party Do
Lady Gol will be thankful but will put on a facade of being angry they
interrupted her fight; think Knuckle from Hunter x Hunter. Tigor will admonish
her for being rude, and she'll sheepishly apologize and thank the party
properly.

Then she'll freeze, as if she had heard something. Somewhere between a deer
listening for a wolf and the fox listening for the mouse beneath the snow she
stands with absolute stillness.

Ask the party what they do ( initiative turn order if someone wants to try
something, everybody gets one chance to do something ).

If they take a closer look at Lady Gol they'll see something like a living
shadow creeping over her skin, before covering her eyes and ears.

She doesn't respond to being talked to or touched, other than to try and shake
off anybody who tries to grab or restrain her.

After everyone has had a chance, she'll bellow in anger, then take off running,
suddenly consumed by rage, down the path towards where the swarm disappeared
to.

Before she makes it halfway, two things happen:
 - she's hit by a powerful attack that sends her flying backwards
 - right after she's hit ( and close enough after that only Zeno is able to tell
   that it happened afterward ) Tigor jumps into the air to catch her, landing
   behind the party

Tigor shouts to the party and asks if they can give him two minutes so he can
heal Lady Gol; that's roughly 6 rounds. He shoots a flare from his armor into
the air that shines with a strange blue light, and suddenly the party can see
what they're fighting: Doubt, or at least a powerful avatar of Doubt's.

*** 2022-06-18
**** Doubt's Longer Term Plans
Doubt is actually using this as a chance to sow the seeds of what they think
will be the defeat of the party; he's going to let them think the weapons of the
Ukor are key to defeating him. He'll avoid Tigor's weapons for a few rounds,
then allow himself to be hit ( but framed as a mistake on Doubt's part ) -- then
immediately say something like "how can this be, how did you discover..." before
fleeing by teleporting away.

Their long-term plan is to kill Tigor after the party goes on a quest or
whatever to get the materials to make more weapons so that right when they're
most sure Doubt can shatter that certainty and infect them with endless doubt.

Right now though, the party has to get Lady Gol past a new wound, one more
mental than physical. The revelation that she was played by that creature has
her doubting that she will be of any use to her family or her people. What good
is her strength, when all it seems to do is get people hurt because she's
constantly outmaneuvered?

**** Fight With The Avatar
[[id:49587b28-d8f1-43a6-964b-1d00d9aebe6d][Psychic Avatar Projection: Battle Form]]

 - describe the [[https://external-preview.redd.it/k0g0N8RfyQdoMPbWb31yHZdoS6NeReMuvgrrWosQCgQ.jpg?auto=webp&s=1db030194c1ee389586b1a5b13e2b653603e990a][creature]] to the players, along with the initial attack
   - klep & zeno's systems seem to have trouble telling if the creature is even
     there ( it whispers "you were so certain your devices would help you see me
     and figure out what i can do... how sad for you" )
   - ureos suddenly feels like they have two... well, they're not human feet (
     "you flit through the battlefield like a sparrow in the brambles, but how
     will you flit when you can't feel your feet?" )
   - fox feels an overwhelming sense that he has or absolutely will fail to
     protect pamki ( "so confident your strength would protect these fools and
     more besides, how will you protect them now?" )
 - every time the avatar attacks it whispers more doubts into the mind of those
   it attacks
 - when Tigor re-joins the fight, Doubt will put on a show that it's suddenly
   nervous, like it's scared of his weapons. this is an act, it's trying to set
   up a chance to really mess with their heads later on by setting up his
   weapons as the only thing that can hurt it, and then shattering that
   certainty so it can plant the idea that they'll never be able to hurt it --
   because if it can do that, it has a chance of being able to make that true.

**** After The Fight
Lady Gol is a wreck; she's curled up in a corner, crying and not looking that great.

Tigor will ask the party if they have any wisdom to share, because they are more
familiar with the needs of other humans; he fears he does not have the right
words to assist Lady Gol in her time of need.

Explain to the party that Lady Tigor has basically been broken spiritually,
Doubt used this as an opportunity to further it's own agenda even though it left
in apparent defeat. The party realizes that the whole battle was a cover; Doubt
was really attacking Lady Gol. It's planted seeds ( though the characters don't
know that yet ) that it will work to make real.

They have to convince her that nothing Doubt has convinced her of is true, or
the seeds will sprout. 

Tigor will speak after the party, and will basically Ted Lasso the
situation. Something along the lines of how she feels as if she is a jarba (
something akin to a rodent, Tigor explains ) trapped in a nest of okin ( snakes
); surrounded by nothing but danger and death. But it isn't the strength in her
arms he follows, or why he trusts her. It's the strength of her heart, shown to
him by a little girl on the day they first met.

Lady Gol will confess to Tigor that she's been hearing whispers that she only
realizes now were that creature, and not just some aspect of her personality,
or some voice of her subconcious. She'll thank the party, and asks if she can
accompany them back to their town; she really dislikes the kind of ceremonies
the ambassador insists on when they travel. That, and she prefers to make an
assessment like the one she's been sent to make with first-hand and unbiased
information. 

She'd much rather just go with them and get to know the folks there a bit before
the rest of the army regiment catches up.

Depending on where in the session we are, call the end or take them back to town.

*** Ghoka Is Being Driven
both insane, and towards a cache of ancient weapons -- by the nightmares, of
course

players find out when one of his men crawls back to town, half dead. he says
ghoka nearly killed him in his madness when he questioned what they were
doing. need to have him talk about something that sounds like a demon to the
folks in-game, but to the players will sound like robots.
*** Mex's Past
Mex knows Ager from way back. Like way back. No, like wayyyyyyy back.

Like 4000 years back.

Mex ( and some of the other Ararholm NPC's ) are actually Ager's old crew. He
gathered them up after all this time so they could fix what they broke.

As in, accidentally letting the Nightmares loose.

That's not what's important though. What's important is the truth about
Mex. She's not really human any more. She's a human mind that was transplanted
into a fire mech from some ancient alien civilization; Ager helped her out by
helping her find the knowledge and tech to build herself a special disguise that
hides her true nature from everyone.

She did this so she could live a normal life -- at the time she just wanted
things to go back to normal.

But she soon realized that "normal" wasn't the same thing she thought it
was. Turns out that in the time since getting turned into a firey doom robot
normal became "going out and looking at cool shit with Ager and the gang". Fact
of the matter is, she realized she had actually forgotten most of her life from
before she had been transformed.

She wants to show Zeno the truth about herself to try and get him to understand
that he's been given a golden opportunity: he gets to choose his family. Not
many folks get that -- the freedom of a (mostly) blank slate, to accept the past
may always be lost but that the future can be spent making happy memories with
the family he chooses to protect. With the family that chooses him back.

Knowing that sometimes there are hard things a kid shouldn't have to deal with,
she gives Zeno the choice:
  - wipe the memories of The Merchant; risky, could affect memories of the gang
  - wipe everything and start fresh
  - hardest option: learn to talk about it all, process it, come to grips with
    it, and then leave it behind. to learn how to move on, from someone who
    experienced something similar ( mex )
  - "choose nothing" -- run, get in his own head, pretend everything is fine
    until you're a gun again

Mex knows who The Merchant really is: a pawn of Doubt. But for that information
to be of any use, Zeno needs to be able to face The Merchant. Zeno is the only
one who knows anything useful about The Merchant, but the team also can't face
it without Zeno.

She lets them know that she's got a score to settle with Doubt

 - Scorn => Fox
 - Anxiety => Belel (Zeno)

*** How Zeno Kills Doubt
Have someone give Zeno a Chuckling Shroud (torment, pg 119) in a bag or
something, and tell him not to use it until he's about to face Doubt. Turns out
that Doubt isn't that tough, or strong, or big -- their power operated on such a
fundamental level that they were all seeing what Doubt /wanted/ to be.

Zeno needs to learn that part of defeating the Nightmares has to do with being
able to rid yourself of the emotions they prey on. How you do it might not
matter, as the Chuckling Shroud is what's blocking Doubt's aura from affecting
Zeno -- Zeno still has doubts, he's human(-ish).
*** Ager's Message To The Party
Felwinter explains that the message is actually a limited-knowledge memory
phantom; basically a copy of Ager's conciousness that he edited down to only
have pertinent information. Ager did this for two reasons: the first being he
didn't trust a fully copy of himself not to get into trouble and mess things
up. The other is that there are things that can never be said aloud, lest the
Nightmares learn what exactly it is you know.

Savu, Captain Togh, Princess Gol, Mex, & Brigette. He only knew Savu, Mex, and
Brigette would be there, other than that he just asks for the "royal daughter of
the Sable Hegemony" and the "runaway child of the Voz Dynasty".


Felwinter asks the party to get Pamki, Brigette, Mex, Savu, "royal daughter of
the Sable Hegemony" and the "runaway child of the Voz Dynasty", and to bring
them to her in the ship. Once they all arrive, she'll play them the message that
will explain a lot.

She bid them follow her into a room, and she plays the "message".

A black and white, grainy hologram springs into being. It's very clearly Ager,
but to those who knew him -- it's also clearly not. It's his image, for sure; it
pretends to breath and look around the room, clearly making eye contact. But
some crucial spark of Ager is not present; his eyes don't have that mischievous
glint, his mouth is missing it's default smarmy grin, and he's not walking
forward to grasp your hands and greet you like old friends.

Some of that old life returns to the hologram when it looks at Pamki, before
quickly fading again.

"Hey y'all." the hologram speaks. At first the voice is tinny and distant, but
as the message continues the quality improves until it's like he's standing in
the room.

"I bet some of you are surprised, and some are smug. Tell whoever won the bet
they need to buy Mex a drink, cause she bet me you'd do that."

From his image and voice, this is a somewhat younger Ager than you all
remember. He looks to be about the age he was when Pamki was around 6 years old.

"By now, you've had a run-in or two with the Nightmares. Sorry about that."

Ager sighs, then sits down in a chair; you all recognize it as the younger
version of the chair in Pamki's office. She sniffles, and the message continues.

"It's funny how even after all this time, I can still be surprised."

He looks up, and continues. His face is sad, like he knows what he's about to
say is going to be painful.

"And you'd think after over six thousand years of walking this planet, I'd have
seen it all. Or at least figured out a way to clean up my mess." He gives a
small chuckle, and shakes his head. "At least a way that didn't involve me dying
quite so soon. Thought I had at least a few more centuries before that became
probable. Of course, that's not the only thing I was wrong about.

"I guess I've got a bit of a story to tell you. Sit down, get comfy. This is
going to be a while."

The room shifts, and portions of the floor flow into comfortable looking chairs,
couches, and bean bags. The hologram patiently waits for you all to make
yourselves comfortable before it continues.

"I'll give you a bit of background, I guess. Probably a good place to start is
when I was born, more than where.

"Yeah, I'm over 6000 years old right now. Right now Pamki is 5."

"Can't forget the 'and a half', though." he says in a stage whisper with a wink.

"That makes me about... oh, six thousand, one hundred and... fourteen? It's been
a while since I gave it any thought. I've had slightly more pressing
concerns. I've been putting off my plans for too long, but for the last five
years it hasn't been for the usual reasons.

"It wasn't because I needed to gather my strength and allies. I didn't need to
spend time setting up a trade empire, or scouting out the old stomping grounds,
or looking for just one more cypher that could tip the scales in my favour.

He looks directly at Pamki.

"No, for the last five and a half years I've been putting off my plans because I
just wanted to be your dad for a bit longer."

He drops his gaze to the floor, before raising his eyes again. His eyes have
changed, they now have some of the old spark in them that some of you remember.

"See, this is thing about living as long as I have. You start to forget some of
the important things. Or at least, I have. Some of my friends have done a much
better job staying... well, staying human. Even Red, though she'd fight me on
that one. Especially you, Red.

His eyes come to rest on Mex. He gives her a small smile before continuing.

"I actually don't remember very much about a lot of my life. Pretty sure it was
the boring parts though, cause who needs to remember every step taken towards
the horizon? I do remember where I was born, though.

"A small village, in a small valley; the only spot to stop if you wanted to make
the trek through the mountains. I spent my boyhood wanting to hitch a ride with
every cart, to tag along with every wandering delver. I stayed though, until
home wasn't there any more.

A dark memory chases across Ager's face, quickly replaced with a look of
determination.

"I went out into the world a young idiot. Depending on who you ask, the only
thing that's really changed since then is the 'young' part. I might be an idiot,
but I'm definitely a lucky one. Spent the next few decades falling into just the
right kind of trouble. Made some friends, helped some folks out, made a small
name for myself.

"Then one day, we heard about it. A ruin unlike any other. Rumors of it had
started spreading about a year earlier, but nobody had taken much stock in
them. Mostly spread in the kind of taverns that such tales usually call home,
by delvers short one too many fingers.

"The ruin that grants wishes.

"Apparently, a whole village had started dreaming of the ruin on the eve of the
winter solstice. A vast cathedral, built of shining white marble, sparkling
crystal, and gleaming gold. The cathedral was located at the center of vast maze
of twisting paths and troubled time. A step could take you forward in time as
well as space. But the treasure guarded by the maze and other numenera was worth
it. The treasure was whatever you wanted.

"The strangest thing was how nobody had to ask what it was called. Somehow, we
all knew it was the White Cathederal.

"Some claimed it was a tame version of the Iron Wind, the mythical 'Blue
Sigh'. Others said it was a machine that could construct whatever you could
imagine. Regardless of what the tale-teller told, the treasure at the heart of
the White Cathederal held the power to give you whatever you wanted.

"Looking back, I'm surprised we got off as lucky as we did. We were so very
stupid back then. The folly of youth, I suppose.

"Anyways. My gang were hanging out in the town square of some small town when we
learned the rumors had some truth to them. We ran into a group of delvers that
we had met a few years back when they had been headed to investigate a ruin they
had heard about. Now they were making their way back home.

"Well, I say it was the same group. That's only partly true. It wasn't the whole
group. Just the survivors. Of the original party of around a dozen, only three
had survived their trek.

"We bought them drinks, and got the story from them.

"None of them could remember how they found out about the ruin, but they
remember what they felt when they heard about the treasure. They decided the
twelve of them would gather up all they had, and go searching for those
ruins. At the very least, it'd make a good story for the tavern, right?

"It took them a year to find the ruin. It took the ruin a week to spit them back
out. Five made it out, although two quickly succumbed to their wounds and left
the land of the living.

"We could tell they had been traumatized by what had happened to them. They had
difficulty remembering what had happened, even when drunker than an algo on
greenberry juice.

"I could tell as my gang and I walked home we all had the same thing on our
minds. That ruin. We remembered that group of delvers, back when we first met
them. Remembered that they hadn't been all that impressive.

"Of course, we talked ourselves into attempting to overcome the ruin too. A few
weeks later we headed out, full of certainty that we'd do better than those
pathetic losers.

"It's only looking back that I can see how much we were being manipulated.

"See, everything about this was the Nightmares. Somehow they had figured out how
to subtly reach out and touch the minds of humans. Trapped in their prison and
forced to work together they wove trap after trap to attempt to get someone to
free them. This was just our turn on the fishing line.

"Unfortunately, we were just what they were looking for.

"The maze wasn't just a maze. I don't know what it had originally been meant to
do, but the Nightmares had corrupted it into a twisted testing apparatus. They
used it to separate the wheat from the chaff, to ensure they could enact their
escape plan.

"See, the Nightmares aren't from this dimension. They're from some strange
mirror of our reality. Every concept in our world has an avatar in that
reality. I don't know how they got to our reality, or how they got trapped, but
I've learned a little about them. Couldn't help it, because otherwise I'd never
learn how to kill them, right?

"Nightmare isn't even what they're called; it's just what we named this group of
invaders. I'm sure that there are avatars for nice things like Courage and
Honor you could name the Justices or something, but I haven't met one yet.

"In order to exist in our reality though, the Nightmares need something: an
anchor. Without one, they're stuck as little more than shadows. They're still
powerful, but they can't work their big mojo until they've been bonded to the
vessel that will become their anchor.

"That's what the maze was for. To find the right suckers to become their
anchors.

"When we made it through the maze, we didn't expect to meet anybody at the
center. But standing there were roughly fifteen creatures, draped and robed in
fine white linen and silk. No part of their bodies could be seen.

"They bade us approach them, and then offered us each a choice of artifacts.

"None of us stopped to think about the situation we were in. About how despite
entering with twenty there were now only fifteen of us. About how uniquely
suited each of us survivors was to overcome a particular challenge within the
maze.

"I certainly didn't stop to think about why the gun I reached out to take so
closely resembled the toy I had carved when I was a child when I wanted to feel
more powerful than my bullies.

"We didn't realize what had happened until many years later. Some of us noticed
sooner than others, but we eventually all got back together to figure out what
was happening to us.

"Things had been a bit weird since we left the maze. We were suddenly heroes
known throughout the land. We got requests for aid, or invites to dinners and
balls, and more offers of riches and earthly pleasures than we could count. But
over time we started to notice something. Where each of us went, strange things
occurred. At first the events happened rarely, but eventually they started
happening more and more often until we finally realized these happenings weren't
natural.

"For one of us, wherever they went fights and arguments broke out as long
buried hatreds were unearthed and fed new fuel. Another found that others became
afflicted with uncertainty, their doubts having grown to overcome and crush
their wills. The ones who found that they seemed to affect those around them
soon learned they had it easy. One of us discovered that staying too long in one
place caused disaster of some kind to befall the area; anxiety dogged their
every step.

"The artifacts we had taken were cursed, or we had been cursed by the
creatures. We decided to gather up all our most powerful weapons and gear, and
we were going to go kill those things or die trying.

"That was our biggest mistake. It turns out the artifacts were cursed, after a
fashion. They were dual purpose devices. One purpose was to aid us, tools we had
all chosen that fit our personalities. The other purpose was to spread the
influence of a particular Nightmare. Each time an artifact influenced someone it
got a bit stronger, and next time was able to influence more people, for longer.

"We didn't realize it, but we had basically been charging them up, filling them
with everything the Nightmares needed to break free.

"I don't remember much of what happened after that. There was a lot of fighting,
and running, and madness. We chased and were chased through ruins and
dimensions, trying to undo what we had done. 

"We know this much though. We let them out, and we became their anchors. We
chased them down, and managed to take out a few of them. Unfortunately, the were
the weaker and dumber ones. We took some losses as well. I've lost some friends
I'm going to miss for the rest of my life.

"Anyways. We split up after that. Some of us figured we'd just die some day, so
they wanted to go and live peaceful lives, or to try and atone for what we had
done. Others immediately dived into trying to find a way to break the anchoring,
or defeat the Nightmares.

"I spent the next few thousand years wandering. I learned some things. I can't
say too much, though. Something about the spoken word and... trans-liminal
psycho-memes? I'm pretty sure Hank was pulling my leg about that part. But
basically, somehow the Nightmares know everything you speak out loud.

The hologram catches your eye with its hand, and you realize it's signing
something to you.

<Journals>

Spelled out, one letter at a time. It repeats the word three times before
stopping.

The whole time this is happening, it continues talking.

"So there's some stuff you're just going to have to discover on your own for
now. But there are some things I can tell you. Here's the basics. Each Nightmare
represents an emotion, or a concept. Of the ones remaining, we're pretty sure
it's just Deceit, Doubt, Hate, Vanity, Despair, Scorn, Anxiety, and Absurdity.

"Each of them has an ability, and you need to be careful they don't get a chance
to use it. Once they have, it can be very tough to undo what they did before it
has chance to take root. We only know a few of these abilities.

"Vanity, for example, can turn almost anyone to their cause if they're able to
figure what someone wants. They turn that want into desire, while filling their
targets heads with thoughts that makes them believe they deserve what the object
of their affection is. Make them believe that Vanity really is willing to share
their power with them, because of course they're worthy of it. That power twists
their mind until they are nothing more than a puppet, a husk of their former
self.

"Scorn is their insidious assassin. Careful and methodical, they weave phantoms
and illusions. They twist the experiences of the target to twist and inflate their
pride. Joking words of encouragement become sarcastic jibes. An innocent cough becomes
twisted into the punchline of a sly joke at the targets expense. At the end of
this road lay death. The target lashes out at the wrong person and either gets
themselves killed; or should they succeed they are driven insane as Scorn strips
away the falsehoods to show that every perceived slight was actually an
expression of love and comradeship.

"Doubt is the one sent to weaken defenses from within. Doubt can plant a seed in
your mind. Just a small thought, a tiny voice that speaks before you fall
asleep. Maybe we can't hurt them, or find them, or even survive. That doubt
grows, fed by both the target as they spiral and Doubt as they pour energy into
the seed of doubt. When that seed sprouts, it changes reality for the
target. Whatever they doubted is now true, for the target. Did the target doubt
they could hurt the Nightmares? Now they can't, no matter what they try. Doubt
tries to target the strongest, to remove key support from their enemies before
one of Doubt's duped allies attacks in force.

"That's all we really know about the Nightmares right now. I'll figure out how
to let you know about anything else we learn.

"Now, how do we deal with them?

"If you asked me six years ago I would have had a plan. Now I'm not so sure
about that plan. But I do have an idea.

"But first, some truths.

The hologram looks directly at Pamki.

"Pamki, you're the reason I tossed out my plan. You helped me remember some
things.

"You forget lots of things when you live as long as I have. One of the more
important things that I forgot is how much the little things matter.

"When I looked into your eyes for the first time I saw the eyes of someone I had
forgotten. My mother. Someone I thought lost to me forever, I saw there in
you. And then you touched me, running your tiny little hands down my finger they
way she would rub my arms to soothe me when I was still a scared little boy.

"I had spent so long focused on how to impose my will that touch had become a
tool, a weapon. "Touch" became just a word in a sentence like "the smallest
touch was all it took to press the button that ended the village".

"When I held you for the first time, I remembered my mother. I remembered losing
her. I remembered all the steps I had taken, down a path that turned me into
someone I feared she wouldn't recognize. Or rather, I feared she /would/ recognize
me. I was no longer the person that made her proud.

There is a sound from somewhere behind the hologram. A little girl walks into
the picture, and Ager picks her up and puts her on his lap. Unlike Ager, the
girl is in color, although her image still looks like it has static.

When he speaks, its to the little girl. It's very clearly a five ( and a half )
year old Pamki.

"Do you know who you remind me of, my little starling? Your grandmother. She'd
be proud of the person you're becoming. But that's nothing next to how proud I
am for you always being so amazing and fearless. The world is yours, Pamki. It
took me a long time to realize you've got the kind of strength the world needs,
especially against the Nightmares. You can lead everyone to a better place,
you've got everything you need.

"I just hope that by the time comes for you to start that I've properly cleared
my mistakes off the board so you have a clearer path to victory.

He looks down at the young Pamki for a moment, before someone else walks into
frame. Unlike Ager or the young Pamki, this figure is as clear as day. A woman,
in a long flowing black skirt with a red shirt with the sleeves rolled up to her
elbows. Her face has a serene beauty, tempered by the strength of will that
emanates from her like the rays of a warm summer sun. Even relaxed and plainly
dressed, every fiber and particle of this woman shouts power. But when her eyes
look at her daughter, all you can see is unending, unconditional love.

She picks up Pamki, and while holding her tight gives Ager a quick kiss. For a
moment you could mistake them for any number of families you've seen in your
travels.

Once Ager is alone agin, he begins speaking again.

"So that means that I've got to go through some stuff I'm really hoping you
already know. And if not, I'm sorry baby girl, but you're going to have to clean
up one of my messes.
