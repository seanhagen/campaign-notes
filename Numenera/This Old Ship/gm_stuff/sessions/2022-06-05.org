* Session 9
** Leaving The Screaming Tower
*** Notes
 - party takes some time to rest up, half a day
   - takes refuge in a room shown to them by Felwinter
   - Felwinter hands out Focuses; functions as a comms device and also a simple
     scanner for numenera; players can ask a single, simple yes-or-no question
     about any numenera
 - as party leaves, they do some scavenging, get 20 shins, 5 apt clay, 9
   responsive synth, 3 synthsteel, and 1 unit of cosmic foam
    
*** Combat
**** VS the hex
hex, armor: 2, health: 8
special: teleport

turn order:
 - klep
 - fox
 - zeno
 - hex
 - ureos

 - the hex refuses to communicate, turns to walk to the back wall
 - zeno shoots the hex, does 17 points of damage
 - ureos is deafened for a day by the loudness of the gun
 - fox punches, gets stuck
 - hex teleports to zeno, shattering one of fox's gloves ( 3 points of damage ),
   hits zeno and sends zeno flying; zeno catches themself with their foot before
   falling off the catwalk
 - ureos teleports to the top of a column, gets his bearing
 - fox moves to a column and climbs to the top, and attempts to regenerate the broken glove
 - zeno rights themself but drops their gun
 - klep asks felwinter to make a ramp, drops his teleporter on the ramp as it
   extends, then climbs down the column
 - hex teleports back down to the ground, walks to the back wall of the room
 - ureos uses a minor illusion to make a fake zeno show up behind the hex and
   cock it's gun
 - fox jumps from one of the columns with a shield, and does 8 points of
   crushing damage
 - fox allows the hex to attack and takes some damage, but retailiates with a
   devestating riposte to absolutely destroy the hex ( and nearly gets conveted
   to a hex because the claws piereced his skin -- last-ditch attempt by the hex
   to accomplish its mission )
*** For Next Session
 - minor/major/crit on initiative roll
 - single level 5 creature is a good fight for four players, 2 level 5 creatures
   might have been tough enough to kill someone
 - npc request: sid the pilot (jack)
