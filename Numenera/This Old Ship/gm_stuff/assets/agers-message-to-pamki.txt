You forget lots of things when you live as long as I have. One of the more
important things that I forgot is how much the little things matter.


For example, take touch. I forgot how important just touching can be. Or rather,
how important one specific kind of touch is the most important. See, for song
long touch had been about big, important things. Things like "imposing my will
on the world around me" meant touching things in big, important ways. Which
usually led to big machines with important buttons to do things like "steal this
important Numenera from that village so I can keep it safer" or "divert this
river so this village making ammo for me doesn't have to go so far for
water". Which of course leads to bigger and more important things like selecting
the paths that nations will take, working on a level above kings and
governments.







- storyish bit
- Ager is really really old
- like he's alive now
- he was alive for a long time before now


- he says nothing about Memory
   - not because he's hiding anything, but it's clear he has no idea who memory is, even though he speaks as if the remaining group of Nightmares includes Memory when counting
   - like he'll say "okay so there are X Nightmares" and then lists each one but doesn't say anything about Memory so the list will be one short

- he used a failsafe to try and contain the Nightmares in Maka-Tho - the mist
- but he hadn't set it properly and didn't fill the interior with the mist as well, so there were trapped survivors who eventually accidentally let them out. They were still trapped, but Ager didn't know they had broken out of containment until he arrived in Ararholm, which was the remains of a border fort from some fallen civilization. 
- he had come back to try and properly dispose of the Nightmares so that Pamki wouldn't have to always be on guard or have to worry they'd get free
- but if she doesn't already know this then Ager wasn't able to deal with it on his own, so he wasn't able to tell her all this already
- he also tells her who her mother really was, and a little bit of how looking back he realizes that he really was happy with her and that he really did love her, but he's not sure he ever really made sure she knew
- (Pamki will explain she did know, Pamki could tell)
- he'll give the location of his three closest labs, which should have enough to get her started, hopefully down the path of her dreams - but Allah help those Nightmares should Pamki have to deal with them
- end with the stanza from Oblivion ("facing fearful odds"), and how "my buddy Henry stole that bit from me, you know. Wait, not Henry. Who was that again? Ah, no worries, I'll look it up later" 
- the end bit is about he's about to go and do something potentially really stupid, that hopefully won't kill him slowly if it does end up killing him
- Pamki should note that the timestamp is a few days before Ager left on his final sojourn alone into the wild, and when he came back he was definitely injured or sick. He had seemed to get better, only for the symptoms to return a few months later and got bad enough he died soon after
