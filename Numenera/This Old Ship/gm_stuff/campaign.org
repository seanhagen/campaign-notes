* This Old Ship
** Style
Ideas on how to run the game, the style, the tone, etc.

- play the really bad guys completely straight -- they should be the completely
  "straight man" to the wackiness of the party 
- less bad ( but still bad ) can be flamboyant, etc, but still be "obviously" evil!
** Travel
# Travel Speeds
- what's marked on the hex sheets is for travel on well maintained trade routes
- the only trade route is the one already marked on the handout map

# Distances 
- 112 hours (4 days, with good weather) on road from Ararholm to City of the Dead 
- About a day from City of the Dead due west to Lost Caravan
- 12 hours south on the road from City of the Dead is the Caravan Attack Site
