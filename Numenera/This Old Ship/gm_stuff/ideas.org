*** npc with faith
This quote from the Dune appendix speaks to me:
"Religion must remain an outlet for people who say to themselves, ‚ÄúI am not the
kind of person I want to be.‚Äù It must never sink into an assemblage of the
self-satisfied."

Need a deeply religious and spiritual NPC who embodies this idea.

*** knight
Someone with an amulet like Merlin's Amulet from Trollhunter.
* Items
** organize
- Pages & images to turn into cyphers and artefacts: https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/92534967346062829/
- The twin proton pistols from Ghostbusters (2016), as energy lasos
* Places
** giant crystal
- like the heartstone in trollhunter, just a massive crystal the size of the
  empire state building
**  Strange Staircase
It's a staircase like the bone staircase in Maya & The Three when they enter the
underworld

* Scenes
**  Seeing in 4D
From [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotGraspTheTrueForm][the "You Cannot Grasp The True Form" on TV Tropes]], specifically one of the
points from the "Real World" section:

  If you could see yourself in the fourth dimension, you'd look like a huge worm
  made of every single version of yourself from every moment across your entire
  life. There would be your embryo at one end and your deceased self at the
  other. All of this is without getting into the idea of branching pathways.
  
* Monsters
** organize

- long term, for multiple sessions, after the town is more secure: the hex (bestiary, pg 64)
- jurulisl (bestiary, pg 69)
- a "consortium" of Kalyptein crabs (bestiary, pg 70) have gained sentence and want the aid of the players
- the hand in the distance is the hand of a Latos (bestiary, pg 74), but this is larger than any seen before - and one day the hand moves
- magathan (bestiary, pg 78), a strange trader comes to town, a few days later people start dying, one every week
- magmid (bestiary, pg 79), the Use section is a good idea
- merkadian soldiers (bestiary, pg 84) start ambushing traders and travellers on their way to ararholm, potentially cutting the town off from outside contact

- one of the NPCs is a mlox (bestiary, pg 86)
- a morl (bestiary, pg 87) has taken up residence in the hot springs, and has killed one person (the only witness claims a white demon killed the victim)
-  nagaina matron (bestiary, pg 89) has a similar request as the minnern, or wants something the is in the possession of the minnern
-  nalurus (bestiary, pg 90) - a travelling hermit has moved into some ruins outside town, the sheriff wants the party to check on him cause the way the hermit is acting is spooking the sheriff
-  nibovian child (bestiary, pg 92), need to be able to talk to the players secretly, but use the "Use" section as hook, fire was seen coming from a homestead and nobody has heard from that family in a few days
-  nibovian companion
-  a colony of odlark in a sealed ruin near the town could be potential allies
-  peerless (pg 97), some drones start following the players after they've searched four ruins, after eight the drones will approach. Seeing don's PC will attempt to attack and take him over
-  orgulous (bestiary, pg 96), used by ghotas gang to protect the entrance to their hideout. There is a secret entrance that bypasses them

-  pygmy hapax (bestiary, pg 100), chasing a jiraskar straight to the village
-  a quishamis (bestiary, pg 102) got teleported into a ruin and want to get back home. Only problem is that home is the Cloudcrystal Skyfields, which the characters can't reach unless they learn how to open the portal back to the Beyond (and figure out how to get to the Skyfields)
-  relentless reaper ( bestiary, pg 106), when someone in the party messes with something in a ruin, they activate a reaper
-  rocira (bestiary, pg 108) will show up before any large battle. Have them show up before a battle the players know is coming, so when they show up before a battle they're not expecting they'll be spooked
-  one of the characters will aquire a shanu (bestiary, pg 113), whether they want it or not
-  voz dynasty noble visiting town attempts to assassinate key figures using a shivern (bestiary, pg 114) that it controls via an artifact. The shivern will kill the noble of freed, and will probably stick around town; the town is full of easy prey and it can't resist. If not taken care of more will be drawn to the town
-  peerless drones are trying to enter a ruin so they can kill a silver orphan (bestiary, pg 115). The orphan will share knowledge of other ruins if the party will bring it back any information about machine intelligences they find

-  a ruin that is apparently an ancient garbage dump is the home of several spurn (bestiary, pg 120) gangs. They'll see evidence of their conflict, maybe even see a battle in the distance. One gang is completely hostile to humans, one is indifferent, the last is friendly. They'll meet one from the indifferent gang first
-  a group of syzygy ghouls (bestiary, pg 122) approaches the town, wishing to become the keepers of the dead.
-  tachyron (bestiary, pg 123) could make a fun travel encounter

-  some old machines that aren't connected to power but are still on is home to a handful of therivar (bestiary, pg 125)
-  titanothaur (bestiary, pg 126). Find a way for this to be an end of campaign boss monster üëπüëπüíÄ
-  a trawl (bestiary, pg 128) will be holding whatever the party has been sent to collect from an ancient ruin. They'll be told that the last three people sent didn't return, so now the client is sending a party
-  valma (bestiary, pg 140) is stuck deep inside a ruin, complaining about being alone. The party are asked to investigate what "the ghost down the chasm" wants so it will leave
- a pack of vapes (bestiary, pg 131) have taken up residence in the entrance chbers of a huge ruin. They attack and try to kill any who come to explore, usually by driving the prey further into the ruin. They pretend to be part of the art in the entrance hall, which helpfully (for the vapes) depicts packs of wolves alongside humanoid hunters
- a varadimos (bestiary, pg 132) could be a potential late game ally if the party can a) free it from where it's stuck and b) bring it what it asks for. Of course it asks in an obtuse and hard to understand fashion
- an old companion of ager has come to town with his warder (bestiary, pg 133), who thinks he's dying. He's suffering from an unknown disease, and dies while in town. He's burried in the cemetery, near ager, but his warder protects his grave and won't leave. The friend is still alive, the disease actually just put him to sleep or into stasis or something
- a weaponozed meme (bestiary, pg 134) awaits in a terminal in a ruin. There should be plenty of dead bodies that detail how the meme kills, and a journal that detail the victims descent into madness and death. The party should be sent searching for an explorer team who came to this ruin a while ago and haven't been heard from, their archeologist patron is getting restless and wants to start cataloguing theruin and will come with the party
- lots of uses for a xaar (bestiary, pg 135). As a recurring small time baddie who keeps trying to find a body that will finally let it destroy the party. As a potential client, asking to be told of any mobile machines the party finds. As a tricky parasite, offering to improve don's characters abilities if it can attach itself to her.
- xacorocax (bestiary, pg 136), kept by ghotas in a nearby ruin. He uses it to punish any who displease him or royally fuck up. The sheriff has heard some rumors, wants the party to investigate and destroy the machine if they can
- after finding a particularly powerful artefact, when trying to leave the ruin the party runs into Ilyania (bestiary, pg 149). She tells them to drop the artefact, and cyphers they have and leave.
- leverett stamper (pg 152) should be encountered just as he's getting killed in a ruin by a gang of bandits. The bandits will attack the party if they are seen. Leverett will be waiting outside the ruin for the party, or approach after the battle. He'll claim the body they saw die was his identical twin. He'll offer to share info if the party will share in return
- read up on the Convergence to see if Magistrix Nelgadara (bestiary, pg 153)
  could make an appearance in the world

## Kanthid
- a nano infecting a grave yard to try and get information from a deceased rival

## Llaric Scorpion
- make it small, and a small group of them is causing trouble for a
  village/homestead/place

## Odlark
- use some!

-- something that appears to be a floating orb, but the orb is actually the
shadow of the thing on the ground ( huzzah for mucking about with physics )

-- eldritch abominations:

"The Final Destination spin-off book Dead Reckoning has the main character Jess
enter what appears to be Death's realm in a dream. There she encounters what is
presumably Death's true form - the vaguely humanoid Death is gigantic, composed
of constantly shifting, crumbling, and regenerating bones from seemingly "every
creature that ever lived", and is covered in what could be loosely described as
robes made from what appears to be still living flesh that twitches and
squirms. From afar, it just looks like a dark mass, and it's constantly emitting
a noise that sounds like static and "thousands of birds all taking flight at the
same time", while its eyes are completely blank, dark voids. Also, anything in
proximity of it ages rapidly."

-- potential location: garden of eden
  --> further idea: maka-tho is the graveyard of the gods ( and some aren't so
  dead )

"Though demons rarely get physical description in the Bible (being mostly evil
spirits capable of disturbing and possessing humans), the Kabbalah offers a lot
more variety of physical forms, ranging from angry, ravenous crows that spread
like fire, to enormous, black giants covered with serpents, to disembodied,
veiled heads with glimpses of horrifying eyes."

"Though they're generally agreed to not be physical beings so much as
metaphorically-described human empires, the four beasts seen by the eponymous
prophet in chapter 7 of Daniel probably deserve mention here. They dominate the
world one after another; the first resembling a winged lion with the heart of a
human, the second a colossal bear that feeds on human flesh, the third a leopard
with four heads and four wings (and in some interpretations, draws on a variety
of big cats, as well), but the most eldritch of them all is the last one, which
is notably not described as looking like any Earthly animal. It is described as
having enormous claws, teeth made of iron, and ten horns which are the ten kings
that rule the empire that the whole beast represents. In addition, the
creature's smallest and most innocuous horn is strongly implied to be the most
powerful and evil world leader the Earth will ever know. This thing is
prophesied to singlehandedly rip the planet to shreds, and it ultimately takes
God Himself to finally kill it at the end of the world."

just a lot in here:
https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/EldritchAbomination/MythologyAndReligion


-- temples where people pray AGAINST god(s)
 -- people who are immortal without infinite youth, are basically skeletons
 forever praying

 "Silla of Inuit Mythology and most of its variations recognized by related
 cultures. Basically it is the air every thing breathes and the main ingredient
 of everything's soul. It is not exactly benevolent either as it wants those
 parts of itself that make up all that lives back, to the point it will convince
 kids to wander out into the tundra where they will freeze to death. It will not
 be completely satisfied until there is no more breathing."

-
* Scenario & Plot Ideas
** organize
- machine turning people into Warhammer 40k servitors
-  - is someone controlling them?
-  - is there an army of them?
- - some are coming out as blitzers
- one of the servitors or blitzers manages to escape before it's mind is wiped, dies after making it to the village, someone recognizes a scrap of clothing or a tattoo

- old world AI "Athena" kidnapped some children because she thought they were her lost children. When party finds her hideout she sends robot animals like from Horizon Zero Dawn to protect her and the children, she thinks they're there to kill the kids. When party reaches her she is afraid for the children, and sad. Will ask if they know where Dr Katherine Halsey is
-the crystals on the region map influence mood and behavior. Blue is calm and rational, red is the numenera version of the movie The Crazies
-southern kingdom has a queen named savathun, eastern kingdom has queen named xivu arath, figure out where oryx is - but use same African language for their names
-the mist actually didn't blanket the region, it was actually more of a shell - powered by the device that used to be in the crater in the mountains
- hive like species is waking up now that the mist is gone
- use a dream sallow to get information from someone whose consciousness lives on in the tree
- farmer starting an orchard is worried that several of it's workers have been missing for a few days
- a group of strange green creatures were seen near some outlying homes, someone needs to investigate. It's a scout party of tactile host (pg 44 of bestiary)
- traveling oddities and curios dealer comes to town with what he claims is an angel. It's actually a person skinned alive and held in stasis. The wings made of all of their skin, in one piece. Folded and cut so that they look closer to feathers made of ivory or some other stone. Is actually a creature that will attack if the stasis field is lowered. It's a human in the second stage of turning into something that looks like the description of angels: wings and wheels of eyes. Every person they attach to and successfully drain the blood of gives them the power to grow a bit closer to their final form. Two wings means two kills, so it's started the process of growing more eyes. It's head, torso, and legs have started to mold and morph into rings

Stuff To Crib From, Somehow (or to Crib More Things From)
- Horizon: Zero Dawn (robot animals, maybe crib a weapon or two, and definitely the weapon robots and the life draining nanobots)
- Destiny 2 (need an Eliksni stand-in, maybe Cabal, definitely Vex and definitely Hive, and see what exotics could become cyphers or artefacts)
- Warhammer 40k (servitors for sure, chaos dimension, Tyranids, eldar, a Primarch hidden and in stasis on earth)
- The Culture, maybe (definitely gonna be a snarky AI somewhere, and see what tech from the novels would make good cyphers or artefacts, and the smaller AI could be useful as well)
- The Expanse
- Hilda (base one of the kids on town on Hilda, crib from the creatures)
- Gravity Falls (bill cypher for sure, crib the creatures too)
- She-Ra (particularly Light Hope's betrayal? definitely the "ancient AI tries to ressurect empire that's long dead by tricking the heroes" bit, Scorpia would make an interesting NPC, strange ship held aloft by vines: https://revisitingfictionhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/op-perfuma.png?w=500 , the weird deer creatures in the Whispering Woods, DEFINIETLY a Madam Razz kind of character -- especially the conciousness lost in time part, the big six-eyed boar from S4E9, Mara, Entrapta, Beast Island -- a site where old broken technology was dumped, has effects on the mind and the garbage bots that look like giant slugs are malfunctioning a bit )
- Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy
- Star Wars
- find more stuff to crib from
- Doctor Who (the floating orbs with skulls inside, the silent library, the weeping angels, sonic screwdriver? the judoon, find other stuff)
- Adventure Time (candy people, other stuff)
- Legend of Korra
- non western fantasy and myth
- Edge of Tomorrow (the aliens, maybe not the resetting day)
- DC comics ( boom tubes )
- Marvel comics

Old Ship Campaign:
- Tahsi is alive, shrunken down inside a miniature robot hospital and stuck in stasis due to a disease she contracted that Ager was unable to find a cure for (ship AI knows about this)
- Tashi is the daughter of the Khan, who knows Ager "stole" her (she wanted to leave and see the world)
- Ager had other children with other women, one of which is the sheriff (Pamki doesn't know, the sheriff does)
- Pamki is asexual, her wife is trans
- sheriff has a seskii (PG 12 in bestiary, basically lizard dog the size of a great Dane)
- someone in town has a thuman, and someone should have something like the lying cat from Saga
- maybe the Hammerfists have an Accelerator as a hidden ally
- something is "chipping" people like Hordak Prime, creating saboteurs and spies
- ancient spore ship that crashed in an earlier age is waking up, unleashing things like Tyranids upon the surrounding area
-

- ancient conqueror ( trophy room full of artefacts from countless worlds ) stuck in his ship under the earth for reasons, will try to trick or strong-arm the party into freeing him

- minor lord (or whatever the Voz Empire's name for them is) comes to town to demand fealty, comes to town on a huge wagon pulled by avatrol (PG 22 in bestiary)(or something else, but then have the avatrol used to pull chariots or something)

:END:
they get alerted that a homestead needs help, sherrif asks them to go check it
out. they find that the homestead is empty, except for a strange hardened
corrugated paper building -- built inside the largest room in the log & synth
cabin on the homestead. all signs points to the family having gone inside. as
they approach, someone from inside speaks.

"hello, is anyone out there?"

the voice will ask them to stay, but not come inside the cardboard maze. they
will be quite insistent about the party staying outside. but if they could hang
out and chat for a while that'd be great.

once the party enters, they find themselves in a tunnel that forces each of them
to crouch a bit. some time after the tunnel is far past what should have been the
other side of the cardboard building it opens up into a wide hallway -- of
cardboard. it looks like a stately manor; it's just that everything is made of
different coloured cardboard.

they must beware:
 - the deadly traps ( otherwise it's not a labrynth )
 - the deadly minotaur ( also a thing required to be a labrynth )

then the party needs to be fed [[id:3df4e78e-7ca2-4226-a8bf-f14616b5deb3][clues]] so that they figure out that they have to
do the following:
  - [[id:c4ba5d96-6c62-427d-826d-e2bc74b58505][delay the minotaur]] so that they have more time not being attacked to explore
  - discover some [[id:d2a98e08-e1d4-45e8-ae12-5b93bfd3fd4c][labrynth npcs]]
  - learn that the labrynth has no center
  - learn that they need to make a center
  - so they can build the power source
  - so they can destroy the power source

*** pulled into the datasphere
something to do while i'm away

the characters are pulled into the datasphere during a strange storm, they're
stuck in the 90's internet somehow. do it in dm's in discord, in character is
normal text, out-of-character talk is spoiler text. put the info about how it'll
work in the spoiler text, describe how to do spoiler text, anything else they
should know.

description idea:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
you find yourself standing inside a small cube, about the size of the room
you're in right now. the cube appears to be made of steel-glass; you can't seem
to break it, or even scratch it. on the other side of the glass all you can see
is a hash of black and white static. in the center of the cube is a chair. what
do you do (describe in one sentence)?
#+END_QUOTE

wait until they sit down. just say "nothing happens" to whatever they do until
they sit down ( food, water, and amenities slide out of the wall when needed )

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
suddenly, a loud "bong" sounds from all around you, and the static is replaced by
darkness. then, you see some glowing white text in the top-left of the face of
the cube directly in front of the chair. it seems to be writing itself. it's in
a language you don't understand, but it seems to be very succinct language, the
sentences are very short. when the text eventually reaches the bottom, it begins
to scroll up. What do you do?
#+END_QUOTE

whatever they do, eventually this happens:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
suddenly, the face of the cube in front of you turns a bright blue, before
dimming enough that you can make out some kind of digital display. there appears
to be some kind of input required. what do you do?
#+END_QUOTE

**** if they inspect the chair
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
you notice that the armrests of the chair seem to have a set of keys built
in. there are 15 keys on each armrest. they're not small enough that you can hit
all the keys without having to move your hands. you also have to either lean
forward or not sit with your back against the chair. whoever built this chair
was larger than you.

what do you do?
#+END_QUOTE
***** if they do nothing
let them know via spoiler text that if they don't do anything, nothing happens, literally.

**** if they don't inspect the chair
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
nothing seems to happen. what do you do?
#+END_QUOTE
***** if they do nothing
let them know via spoiler text that if they don't do anything, nothing happens, literally.

**** once they press a button
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
you see a character show up in the input field
#+END_QUOTE

show them a picture of the layout of the keys, with strange symbols on each
key. in a different colour on each key put a number.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
what do you type?
#+END_QUOTE

whatever they type, continue on

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
the input fields flash red, and then clear. it seems you didn't type in the
right thing. what do you do?
#+END_QUOTE

do that a few more times, depending on how often the person is responding

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
the input fields flash red one last time, then they go grey. a strange being
pops into existence to the right of the input field. its body is like a spiral
that has been stretched tall, with two great bugged out eyes stuck on random
parts of the spiral and eyebrows hovering strangely above them. part of the
spiral moves, and a low droning voice speaks in a language you don't
understand.

what do you do?
#+END_QUOTE

it's clippy. show them a picture if they don't clue in.

having already! anyways."

:END:
they start out in a low res data arena. like the first wolfenstein game low
res. each character should get different visuals. one gets fantasy, one gets
sci-fi, one gets point and click adventure, or pick some old dos games and
that's how they view the world.

maybe one will be in a fantasy realm, make it seem pretty much like some stock d&d
world. have them go on a 1st level adventure ("go kill some rats") or something.

they should eventually end up in a virtual world that turns on the other
screens. creatures and terrain appears as holograms, and the floor moves to
simulate the terrain. it should still be pretty low res, though; closer to doom
than half-life

don't let them meet up with the other characters for a little while, and don't
bring them all together at once. they also shouldn't actually talk to each
other; i should relay what they say to each other. that way i can mess with them
by having the other characters occasionally be npcs -- or have an npc take over
suddenly when they're hit with the dreaded netsplit

also need to figure out how long clippy stays around, and if he's the villan or
not.

would be fun to have a wholy-digital villan to throw into the mix
******** what UREOS sees
******** what FOX sees
******** what KLEP sees
******** what BELEL sees
******** what ZENO sees
nothing "visual"; it's like his eyes are disconnected but he's still receiving
targeting telemetry. he basically processes the world as if he was in like a
prototype of a prototype of a prototype of a 3D video game. everything is basic
geometry; blocks and spheres mostly. he doesn't see a bunch of those making up a
person, no: until a person poses a threat they're just a sphere. the more
dangerous someone is, the more details are filled in.

however, no matter whether someone is a sphere or someone is a very realistic 3d
model, zeno is always able to pull up a pretty simple interface that's closer to
being something from the days of the atari than anything newer. he can get
details about each entity, and can toggle some of that information to
permanently display. for example, if zeno opened the menu and chose the option
correct option, he could see information for an entity, such as it's name. by
selecting the name and using the correct command, he could have the name show up
above the entity ( thankfully in a small enough font that it's not taking up
like an 8th of your view ).

otherwise your viewpoint is like that of a camera that hovers at about where
Zeno's head is, and you can see some simple geometries making up your body. you
can get a more detailed view of your limbs but that requires more processing
power. the more definition you see for your body & limbs, the less you get in
other places.

that viewpoint is viewed through the screen in front of the chair. the screen to
your left is like if you were using an IRC client on the command line. what
people say to you shows up here as chat messages.

the screen to your right is kind of like a computer desktop, there are some
programs you can open that allow you control over some states of your body, or
give you access to custom scanners or other inputs

behind you is a screen seemingly showing system status, like the health readout
for a mech warrior in one of those video games. you can see a bunch of health
statistics, including stuff about your mental stability. there seem to three
windows open on this screen showing three different faces; these are where
different advisor programs will attempt to assist your decision making abilities

the strangest thing is that despite the spatial positioning of the screens as
they appear when you focus on one of them, you are also able to perceive all of
them simultaneously as well -- just with slightly less detail on each screen.

this is what you currently see on the view screen:

you are standing in a non-descript box, with what appears to be an egress portal
set into the wall to your left. before you hovers a purple sphere.

what do you do? The commmand "C-x C-b overlay-interface" opens an overlay with
commands for what zeno can do -- think of it like a hydra in emacs, but with a
font so big and blocky it takes up a pretty big party of the "input camera
view". otherwise, use the chat window to say something ( use whatever notation
you want to mean what zeno is /doing/ vs what he's *saying*. )



***** if they do anything else, or they do nothing
clippy watches them, keeps talking but they can tell it's switching languages,
none of them human until he finally gets to english, like days later. ask them
what they do
****** if they talk
[[id:c0e57136-2f43-4432-8036-16e79779c9bb][go here]]
****** if they do nothing
clippy just keeps talking for a few more days before leaving
****** if they hit more keys
clippy comes back, all that wil repeat again. if they keep the cycle up, clippy
will get agitated, will seem to be pleading with them to just talk.
