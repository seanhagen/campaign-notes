** Sketches
*** npc with faith
This quote from the Dune appendix speaks to me:
"Religion must remain an outlet for people who say to themselves, “I am not the
kind of person I want to be.” It must never sink into an assemblage of the
self-satisfied."

Need a deeply religious and spiritual NPC who embodies this idea.

*** knight
Someone with an amulet like Merlin's Amulet from Trollhunter.
* Items
** organize
- Pages & images to turn into cyphers and artefacts: https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/92534967346062829/
- The twin proton pistols from Ghostbusters (2016), as energy lasos
* Places
** giant crystal
- like the heartstone in trollhunter, just a massive crystal the size of the
  empire state building
**  Strange Staircase
It's a staircase like the bone staircase in Maya & The Three when they enter the
underworld

* Scenes
**  Seeing in 4D
From [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotGraspTheTrueForm][the "You Cannot Grasp The True Form" on TV Tropes]], specifically one of the
points from the "Real World" section:

  If you could see yourself in the fourth dimension, you'd look like a huge worm
  made of every single version of yourself from every moment across your entire
  life. There would be your embryo at one end and your deceased self at the
  other. All of this is without getting into the idea of branching pathways.

* Monsters
** organize
- grush (bestiary, pg 62)
- long term, for multiple sessions, after the town is more secure: the hex (bestiary, pg 64)
- jurulisl (bestiary, pg 69)
- a "consortium" of Kalyptein crabs (bestiary, pg 70) have gained sentence and want the aid of the players
- the hand in the distance is the hand of a Latos (bestiary, pg 74), but this is larger than any seen before - and one day the hand moves
- magathan (bestiary, pg 78), a strange trader comes to town, a few days later people start dying, one every week
- magmid (bestiary, pg 79), the Use section is a good idea
- merkadian soldiers (bestiary, pg 84) start ambushing traders and travellers on their way to ararholm, potentially cutting the town off from outside contact
- a minnern (bestiary, pg 85) in a ruin - but it wants the players to steal something from the ship under the town
- one of the NPCs is a mlox (bestiary, pg 86)
- a morl (bestiary, pg 87) has taken up residence in the hot springs, and has killed one person (the only witness claims a white demon killed the victim)
-  nagaina matron (bestiary, pg 89) has a similar request as the minnern, or wants something the is in the possession of the minnern
-  nalurus (bestiary, pg 90) - a travelling hermit has moved into some ruins outside town, the sheriff wants the party to check on him cause the way the hermit is acting is spooking the sheriff
-  nibovian child (bestiary, pg 92), need to be able to talk to the players secretly, but use the "Use" section as hook, fire was seen coming from a homestead and nobody has heard from that family in a few days
-  nibovian companion
-  a colony of odlark in a sealed ruin near the town could be potential allies
-  peerless (pg 97), some drones start following the players after they've searched four ruins, after eight the drones will approach. Seeing don's PC will attempt to attack and take him over
-  orgulous (bestiary, pg 96), used by ghotas gang to protect the entrance to their hideout. There is a secret entrance that bypasses them
-  plasmar (bestiary, pg 98), protecting a ruin that an archeologist wants to explore but they nearly killed him last time he approached
-  pygmy hapax (bestiary, pg 100), chasing a jiraskar straight to the village
-  a quishamis (bestiary, pg 102) got teleported into a ruin and want to get back home. Only problem is that home is the Cloudcrystal Skyfields, which the characters can't reach unless they learn how to open the portal back to the Beyond (and figure out how to get to the Skyfields)
-  relentless reaper ( bestiary, pg 106), when someone in the party messes with something in a ruin, they activate a reaper
-  rocira (bestiary, pg 108) will show up before any large battle. Have them show up before a battle the players know is coming, so when they show up before a battle they're not expecting they'll be spooked
-  one of the characters will aquire a shanu (bestiary, pg 113), whether they want it or not
-  voz dynasty noble visiting town attempts to assassinate key figures using a shivern (bestiary, pg 114) that it controls via an artifact. The shivern will kill the noble of freed, and will probably stick around town; the town is full of easy prey and it can't resist. If not taken care of more will be drawn to the town
-  peerless drones are trying to enter a ruin so they can kill a silver orphan (bestiary, pg 115). The orphan will share knowledge of other ruins if the party will bring it back any information about machine intelligences they find
-  a splurge (bestiary, pg 119) was found in the garbage pit growing outside the adventurer's camp, the sheriff needs the party to find a better place for garbage before a larger group is attracted to the garbage
-  a ruin that is apparently an ancient garbage dump is the home of several spurn (bestiary, pg 120) gangs. They'll see evidence of their conflict, maybe even see a battle in the distance. One gang is completely hostile to humans, one is indifferent, the last is friendly. They'll meet one from the indifferent gang first
-  a group of syzygy ghouls (bestiary, pg 122) approaches the town, wishing to become the keepers of the dead.
-  tachyron (bestiary, pg 123) could make a fun travel encounter
-  terror bird(bestiary, pg 124) is another good wilderness encounter
-  some old machines that aren't connected to power but are still on is home to a handful of therivar (bestiary, pg 125)
-  titanothaur (bestiary, pg 126). Find a way for this to be an end of campaign boss monster 👹👹💀
-  a trawl (bestiary, pg 128) will be holding whatever the party has been sent to collect from an ancient ruin. They'll be told that the last three people sent didn't return, so now the client is sending a party
-  valma (bestiary, pg 140) is stuck deep inside a ruin, complaining about being alone. The party are asked to investigate what "the ghost down the chasm" wants so it will leave
- a pack of vapes (bestiary, pg 131) have taken up residence in the entrance chbers of a huge ruin. They attack and try to kill any who come to explore, usually by driving the prey further into the ruin. They pretend to be part of the art in the entrance hall, which helpfully (for the vapes) depicts packs of wolves alongside humanoid hunters
- a varadimos (bestiary, pg 132) could be a potential late game ally if the party can a) free it from where it's stuck and b) bring it what it asks for. Of course it asks in an obtuse and hard to understand fashion
- an old companion of ager has come to town with his warder (bestiary, pg 133), who thinks he's dying. He's suffering from an unknown disease, and dies while in town. He's burried in the cemetery, near ager, but his warder protects his grave and won't leave. The friend is still alive, the disease actually just put him to sleep or into stasis or something
- a weaponozed meme (bestiary, pg 134) awaits in a terminal in a ruin. There should be plenty of dead bodies that detail how the meme kills, and a journal that detail the victims descent into madness and death. The party should be sent searching for an explorer team who came to this ruin a while ago and haven't been heard from, their archeologist patron is getting restless and wants to start cataloguing theruin and will come with the party
- lots of uses for a xaar (bestiary, pg 135). As a recurring small time baddie who keeps trying to find a body that will finally let it destroy the party. As a potential client, asking to be told of any mobile machines the party finds. As a tricky parasite, offering to improve don's characters abilities if it can attach itself to her.
- xacorocax (bestiary, pg 136), kept by ghotas in a nearby ruin. He uses it to punish any who displease him or royally fuck up. The sheriff has heard some rumors, wants the party to investigate and destroy the machine if they can
- after finding a particularly powerful artefact, when trying to leave the ruin the party runs into Ilyania (bestiary, pg 149). She tells them to drop the artefact, and cyphers they have and leave.
- leverett stamper (pg 152) should be encountered just as he's getting killed in a ruin by a gang of bandits. The bandits will attack the party if they are seen. Leverett will be waiting outside the ruin for the party, or approach after the battle. He'll claim the body they saw die was his identical twin. He'll offer to share info if the party will share in return
- read up on the Convergence to see if Magistrix Nelgadara (bestiary, pg 153)
  could make an appearance in the world

## Kanthid
- a nano infecting a grave yard to try and get information from a deceased rival

## Llaric Scorpion
- make it small, and a small group of them is causing trouble for a
  village/homestead/place

## Odlark
- use some!

-- something that appears to be a floating orb, but the orb is actually the
shadow of the thing on the ground ( huzzah for mucking about with physics )

-- eldritch abominations:

"The Final Destination spin-off book Dead Reckoning has the main character Jess
enter what appears to be Death's realm in a dream. There she encounters what is
presumably Death's true form - the vaguely humanoid Death is gigantic, composed
of constantly shifting, crumbling, and regenerating bones from seemingly "every
creature that ever lived", and is covered in what could be loosely described as
robes made from what appears to be still living flesh that twitches and
squirms. From afar, it just looks like a dark mass, and it's constantly emitting
a noise that sounds like static and "thousands of birds all taking flight at the
same time", while its eyes are completely blank, dark voids. Also, anything in
proximity of it ages rapidly."

-- potential location: garden of eden
  --> further idea: maka-tho is the graveyard of the gods ( and some aren't so
  dead )

"Though demons rarely get physical description in the Bible (being mostly evil
spirits capable of disturbing and possessing humans), the Kabbalah offers a lot
more variety of physical forms, ranging from angry, ravenous crows that spread
like fire, to enormous, black giants covered with serpents, to disembodied,
veiled heads with glimpses of horrifying eyes."

"Though they're generally agreed to not be physical beings so much as
metaphorically-described human empires, the four beasts seen by the eponymous
prophet in chapter 7 of Daniel probably deserve mention here. They dominate the
world one after another; the first resembling a winged lion with the heart of a
human, the second a colossal bear that feeds on human flesh, the third a leopard
with four heads and four wings (and in some interpretations, draws on a variety
of big cats, as well), but the most eldritch of them all is the last one, which
is notably not described as looking like any Earthly animal. It is described as
having enormous claws, teeth made of iron, and ten horns which are the ten kings
that rule the empire that the whole beast represents. In addition, the
creature's smallest and most innocuous horn is strongly implied to be the most
powerful and evil world leader the Earth will ever know. This thing is
prophesied to singlehandedly rip the planet to shreds, and it ultimately takes
God Himself to finally kill it at the end of the world."

just a lot in here:
https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/EldritchAbomination/MythologyAndReligion


-- temples where people pray AGAINST god(s)
 -- people who are immortal without infinite youth, are basically skeletons
 forever praying

 "Silla of Inuit Mythology and most of its variations recognized by related
 cultures. Basically it is the air every thing breathes and the main ingredient
 of everything's soul. It is not exactly benevolent either as it wants those
 parts of itself that make up all that lives back, to the point it will convince
 kids to wander out into the tundra where they will freeze to death. It will not
 be completely satisfied until there is no more breathing."

Folded and cut so that they look closer to feathers made of ivory or some other stone. Is actually a creature that will attack if the stasis field is lowered. It's a human in the second stage of turning into something that looks like the description of angels: wings and wheels of eyes. Every person they attach to and successfully drain the blood of gives them the power to grow a bit closer to their final form. Two wings means two kills, so it's started the process of growing more eyes. It's head, torso, and legs have started to mold and morph into rings

** upcoming story ideas
*** sable army regiment
new npcs:
 - liuetenant kernel ado cheem
 - senior ambassador kula otoke
 - lady gol tilrade, daughter of midnight, holder of the sable shield

ado is a well intentioned man, trying to do his best. however, he's an honest
man in way over his head in the intricate games of the royal court. can easily
be led astray by those he trusts, but has a fairly unbreakable moral code. that
moral code is part of why he's risen so high, it's also why without the backing
of one of the royal family he won't be rising any higher.

kula is actually a minion of one of the nightmares. his goal is to try and twist
things so that the party seems like agressors that have to be dealt with. he
wants to prove to his master that he's worthy of power. used to be ghoka's
handler, until ghoka went off the rails in maka tho. 

lady tilrade is the fourth in line to the throne of the sable hegemony ( not
that it truly matters, as the queen is -- as far as everyone can tell --
immortal ). she wants to put her mark on the world, and thinks that maka tho is
her path to glory and honour. needs to present a very rigid kind of honour, a
good story opportunity for the party to get to help someone become a better
person if they want -- potentially exactly the thing they need to do to fight
the nightmares. maybe dealing with kula depends on getting lady tilrade to
change her beliefs about honour, and the worth of glory.
**** the lost regiment
before they leave the screaming tower, felwinter has a gift for the party:
communication devices. they're small nodules that adhere to the skin behind the
ear, but can pick up subdermal speaking ( or maybe even reads what you want to
say ) and transmits it so it sounds like you're in the same room. they have
limitations, but they should come in handy more often than not.

the party is found by some scouts as they make their way back to
ararholm. they're brought before the lt kernel, who asks for their aid in
helping rescue a lost squad. they were sent to investigate a strange ruin, and
haven't been heard from since. if they aid the lt kernel, he will help the party
back to ararholm by giving them plains striders ( beasts not unlike horses, but
he expects them back -- he's heading to ararholm and will get them back when he
meets up with them there. he lets them know he's doing this partially as a
thanks if they help his men, but also as a diplomatic gesture so that the town
is ready and not worried about the approaching army regiment ).

the ruin is bizzare. a large black monolithic structure, rising at least 200
meters into the air ( about 1 + 1/10th the size of the space needle in seattle
), and at least 50 to a side. it stands on a patch of glassy black obsidian
about 1km to a side.

20 meters north of the monolith is the entrance: a hole in the ground. set into
the stone is a square, 1 meter deep. the square is about 30 meters to a
side. set into the square is a funnel, the edge of which touches each of the
four sides of the square. it slowly curves down into a hole about 10 meters in
diameter.

it's hard to get in, because gravity is weird and makes getting in tricky
without falling and sliding in. there is some kind of force screen protecting
the entrance, things that touch it disappear. it's hard to tell if they're
getting destroyed or not though, as the only view of the entrance is from drones
sent to survey the entrance as soldiers made attempts to enter.

the trick is that if you just walk down the funnel you'll be fine, gravity has
been changed here so that it's always where the soles of your feet are
pointing. so if you slide in, you'll always be sliding down without being able
to stop; it'll be more like falling than sliding. this only applies to sentient
creatures though. most animals are too dumb to care, but there are some
crow-like birds that use the effect to play around by flying upside
down. inanimate objects treat the slope as a flat surface.

inside the tube twists and turns, and ends up leading back up above ground ( you
think, there are no windows to check ). not only above ground, but at 90 degrees
to the ground. they're actually inside the monolith, which will become clear
after a little bit more walking and they find themselves inside a room with
obsidian glass walls.

they get alerted that a homestead needs help, sherrif asks them to go check it
out. they find that the homestead is empty, except for a strange hardened
corrugated paper building -- built inside the largest room in the log & synth
cabin on the homestead. all signs points to the family having gone inside. as
they approach, someone from inside speaks.

"hello, is anyone out there?"

the voice will ask them to stay, but not come inside the cardboard maze. they
will be quite insistent about the party staying outside. but if they could hang
out and chat for a while that'd be great.

once the party enters, they find themselves in a tunnel that forces each of them
to crouch a bit. some time after the tunnel is far past what should have been the
other side of the cardboard building it opens up into a wide hallway -- of
cardboard. it looks like a stately manor; it's just that everything is made of
different coloured cardboard.

they must beware:
 - the deadly traps ( otherwise it's not a labrynth )
 - the deadly minotaur ( also a thing required to be a labrynth )

*** First Protector
Is lying.

Their name is Rhul.

It wasn't the abhumans who were attacking, it was Rhul. They've been trying to
become immortal and all-powerful for a LONG time now. They have probably gotten
closer than any other human in this age. The attack on the at-the-time peaceful
abhumans kicked off a massive war they nearly lost, until the people of Sudboia
and the Abhumans came together to defeat the First Protector -- whose name at
the time better translates into "The Disciple".

The First Protector is actually the person or abhuman who sacrificed themselves
to trap Rhul in the tower -- which was the outcome that [[id:a81d4099-1451-409d-80b2-6c9ed6457109][Memory]] had been working
towards at the time.

So now when candidates come, they do a little make-work quest for Rhul, and then
make a pledge on the device the actual First Protectors used to trap Rhul, and
leave. Unless Rhul or Memory decides to kill them. Or they ask too many
questions.

Rhul has spent the last few centuries trying to find a way to break whatever
holds him inside the tower. He's also using it as an opportunity to try and
shape the Sudboian people into a more willing army for when he does eventually
get free. He's almost accomplished this, too -- Ibahka Tan is exactly who Rhul
wants in charge when he gets out.

Hint: it's who Memory wants in charge too.

The Tower is actually a trap meant for the Nightmares. Memory manuvered Rhul
into it so that he'd either disarm it and get free ( and disable the trap in the
process ) or he'd at least be a handy spot to send potential threats; Rhul is
plenty powerful enough at this point and takes cues from Memory on who to kill.

Basically, the first Sacred Protectors knew their duty was to tie their
lifeforce to the tower so that when they died their "life force" or "soul" or
whatever the tower uses for energy would get transferred to the tower to continue
powering the trap. Because Rhul isn't a Nightmare the Tower can't kill them, so
it requires more sacrifices to keep itself powered up to keep Rhul trapped.

However, this is where both Rhul and the Sudboian people are being played by
Rhul.

There is a way to kill Rhul, and that's by making it to the center of the
labyrinth and freeing the abhuman there. Rhul locked them up long ago so they
could focus on finding a way out of the tower. The abhuman is the leader of the
abhumans who fought alongside the Sudboians to try and kill Rhul.

The Tower doesn't need more sacrifices. The initial sacrifice wasn't meant to be
-- it was actually the only choice left to the human First Protector. The intial
plan that the First Protectors came up with had failed, and so had their
backups. See, the Tower is actually a powerful Numenera meant to be used to
force two parties to come to some kind of agreement. The first entity to enter
the Tower gets to sets the terms of what's being agreed to. In this case it was
the human First Protector who messed up ( just a tiny bit ) by saying that
either they'd be leaving or Rhul would be.

This meant they were all locked in there until either Rhul was dead or both
First Protectors were.

The sacrifice was the only option they had left: by using a dangerous Numenera
the human First Protector empowered the abhuman enough to be on equal terms with
Rhul. However, this created a stalemate that has been unbroken for over a
thousand years. Rhul managed to trick the remaining First Protector into a
different trap, where they've been for the last 800 years. In that time Rhul has
been able to twist the history ( with the aid of Memory, of course ) of what
happened until he was the valiant hero sacrificing themselves for the good of
humanity.

However, Rhul got lucky with his choice of trap; it's a timelock. The First
Protector within is aware of what happens in the room he's trapped in and has a
limited communication ability, but is otherwise completely unable to effect the
world around himself.

What neither Rhul or Memory knows is that the device that new candidates make
their pledge on is still working. Nobody knows this except the remaining First
Protector. What it's been doing though -- that's something Memory and Rhul would
change if they could.

Every time someone touches it, some of their life force goes to the First
Protector. The exact same way as the sacrifice, except a smaller amount. The
Numenera was originally built to power up champions before battle by sacrificing
"unworthies" -- but it doesn't require death to transfer some power. Dying while
touching the device just means all your life force / soul / whatever goes to the
First Protector instead of... where ever it would go otherwise.

What this means is that for the last 1000+ years the First Protector has been
getting stronger. Tiny bits, but a tiny bit every ten years or so ads up over
time.

They're now more than strong enough to handle Rhul.

If freed, the First Protector will thank the party, help them kill Rhul, and
then go see if their people are okay -- and try to teach them their real
history. That they fought with humanity against Rhul and his master, The
Witness. 

He'll give the party an info crystal -- the same kind of crystal they (by now)
will have been looking for to power the ship back up. It contains the true
history of the conflict with the Nightmares, and what is known about the
Nightmares.

got struck by lightning from a strange storm. The rest of the town is fine --
some others were also pulled in but either got spat out or found their own way
back to their bodies.

Until they exit the datasphere, they won't be able to remember the lightning strike.
