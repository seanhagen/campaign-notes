*** Rulings
 - going up a level on the damage track is a level 4/6 difficulty task depending
   on if the character is impaired or debilitated
 - healing points in a pool is an intellect task with the difficulty equal to
   how many points they're trying to heal
*** Other Notes
 - maps will be symbolic on world anvil instead of using hex paper, players won't
   be doing cartography of the area
 - determine what the bandits had on them that the party takes
 - map out some more ruins on the overworld -- maybe find something to do the
   mapping digitally, so it's easier to run off the laptop
 - trade and stuff: stores that sell common goods will take shins, merchants that
   sell rarer stuff will barter ( or take a LOT of shins, like more than the
   item is really worth )
