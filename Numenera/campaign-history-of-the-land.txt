[h2]Mists and What Lay Within[/h2]

Despite what Caldanians or the Mutanen think, the mists of Maka-Tho didn't lay
upon the land like a blanket. It did not smother everything, drawing moisture
from the land like some great sponge.

Maka-Tho was a protective barrier.

But before the mist barrier, we must talk of the ship.

Millions of years ago, this ship was abandoned on the earth. If there are
intelligences within the ship, they have long forgotten how the ship ended up on
the ground instead of within the void. The ship has actually spent most of its
time [i]within[/i] the earth, the alloys and materials making up the exterior of
the ship able to withstand the crushing pressure and heat of the flowing rock
deep within the earth. A sign that the ship was built to travel something other
than the void, perhaps, or maybe it's just that the civilization who built the
ship wanted to ensure it would last until the heat death of the universe.

Either way, the ship was subsumed into the earth and spent eons drifting beneath
the surface. A treasure ship, full of plunder, but unknown and unacessible. At
some point in the last two thousand years, the ship was spat out of the mantle
and into the crust, eventually coming to lay with a portion near the
surface. This is what Ager discovered when he ventured into Maka-Tho.

However, the ship didn't survive the journey through fire and pressure
unharmed. Parts of the ship broke off, entire sections riven from the ship. Held
within the grip of the magma though, the parts didn't drift apart that
much. Sections that weren't crushed into an ingot of strange metal trailed and
surrounded the ship like the shoal of fish that attend a shark. These pieces
have also been spat up by the earth, coming to lay underneath Maka-Tho and
awaiting discovery.

One of these pieces, the first to be discovered, was the device that created the
mist. Eventually uncovered by rain and wind at the top of a mountain, it was
activated such a long time ago that there are no tales in Calda or Sudboia that
it was never there. So long as there have been people in this area of the Ninth
World, the mists of Maka-Tho have been there.

This device created a barrier around Maka-Tho several miles deep. The skies of
Maka-Tho were always pink, the shade and hue determined by the position of the
sun. One issue for those living beneath the protection of the mists was
water. Rain in Maka-Tho was a rarity; giant storms of wind and rain don't happen
because the mists dulled any wind and clouds large enough for storms lost their
moisture to the mists upon colliding with it. No, the only rain in Maka-Tho used
to come from small clouds that would at most contain an hour or two of
rain. Anything larger tended to float high enough to get absorbed into the
mists.

The flora and fauna of Maka-Tho adapted quite well, after the first few
years. Some animals shifted territory to favour water over any other resource,
even food. Lake sides and river edges became home to creatures who jealously
guarded their land. Other animals adapted to life with less water, gathering
what they needed from the food they ate -- or in some cases, what little
moisture was in the air.

Some of the explorers did manage to make their way through the mists. Those who
managed to survive a little longer were faced with an inhospitable land that
viewed them as walking water bottles. Enough have survived to help the
homesteaders and friendly folks who travel into the area searching for a new
life. Known as Danuwan Rasa, the Lost Folk, these people aren't often looking to
rejoin society after so long on their own.

However, they can be enticed to tell a few tales, especially if you offer them a
drink or three. They hold onto their secrets tightly but with enough cunning or
charisma they can be encouraged to tell tales. A great skeleton that lay to the
south. A swamp along the river's shore that is nothing but massive fungi and
strange creatures at the edge of sight. A grove of crystals on the northern edge
of the river, a dead forest that speaks and a living one that is more silent
than the grave.

If you're lucky, you'll get to hear a tale from one of the really old and
experienced Danuwan Rasa. The tale is that across the river and far to the north
is a land where the mist helped instead of hindered. Pink trees with blossoms
that spray the devouring mist protect a small kingdom from before the Ninth
World. Where a strange people who know of ancient mysteries dwell. None of the
Danuwan Rasa agree on what they look like or why they're there. Humans who guard
the tomb of an ancient evil. Visitants who see a way home. Puppet flesh of some
god or demon, trying to find a way into our reality. Humans from the future,
lost in a paradise they don't wish to leave.

There are many stories about Maka-Tho, and the things that once lived beneath
its mists.
