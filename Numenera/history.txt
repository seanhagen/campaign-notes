[h2]The Kingdom of Calda[/h2]
The land to the south where the PCs spent most of their lives is not happy about Maka-Tho. They don't like that what used to be their shield against both the unknown things of the north and their belligerent Eastern neighbours is gone. They really don't like that one of the first people to not only settle the region but find a powerful numenera was someone not from Calda. 

What they want is to control all of Maka-Tho. They've sent some scouts to see if they can find other terminals for the Singhan Roots. If they do, then they can easily bypass the Grey Sea to create a stronghold to expand from. There's a good chance they'll find at least one -- in the capital there is a tunnel of the Singhan Roots that is collapsed that heads North. The leaders of the city are fairly certain that tunnel leads to somewhere in Maka-Tho, but without knowing where it comes out they don't want to expend the effort to clear the tunnel. Until they're sure they know whats on the other side, they're not opening that tunnel.

While their preference is for Maka-Tho to become another province in the Sable Hegemony, there are other results they'd be happy with. They can live with Maka-Tho becoming some kind of dependent territory. A fully independent nation that is friendly to Calda is acceptable, so long as some of the ruling class are families from Calda with strong ties back to thei rhome.

What they will go to war to prevent is Maka-Tho becoming part of, or subservient to the Voz Dynasty. After centuries of war, the eastern border of Calda no longer directly borders that of the Voz Dynasty. It's now a dangerous No-Mans Land, a region of the Ninth World twisted by the weapons and technologies unleashed. There are sections of No-Mans Land where you need a space suit to survive, places you don't go without a battalion to ensure you can fight off the things that live there. Both countries want the other to stop existing, but they're both strong enough to ensure that any war between them will take centuries to complete and will probably destroy more land than they already have. 

Maka-Tho used to stand between the northern edge of Calda and the lands of Sudboia. Like a square on a checkerboard that neither could enter, Maka-Tho capped one end of No-Mans Land.

But now that the mists are gone, both countries are scouting out the land and sending small armies out to find good locations to fortify.  The going is slow, as neither knows the land well enough to ensure that any strong point doesn't have some unknown weakness.

Things have also progressed slowly because the rulers of both kingdoms shared the sentiments of their citizens: what if the mist retreating is temporary? What happens if it comes back? So neither kingdom was willing to send more than small token forces to scout the land and try to find defensible places to build fortresses. However, as the mood of their populace shifted, so to did the moods of the rulers. 

Calda sent a battalion strength division of 500 soldiers into Maka-Tho about a year ago. Rather than following the trail set out by Ager Hammersplint, they went south. Apparently their orders were to find a way to secure the northern side of the mountain ranges, and if possible find a route through the mountains. The leaders of Calda are currently favouring a slower expansion into Maka-Tho until they have a route that doesn't require crossing the Grey Sea. The reason is pretty simple: if caught in the Grey Sea, any army is at a massive disadvantage because they would be unable to build any kind of fortifications to protect their army. Can't dig to create trenches, can't build something out of wood or stone because the Grey Sea will absorb it. The last time a large scale battle broke out between two forces that clashed with melee, neither side was heard from again. So Clada is playing it safe until they find either safe passage through the mountains or a new terminal for the Singhan Roots. 

Once they've accomplished that, then the next phase of their plans for Maka-Tho beings. But only the King & Queen know those plans and they're being very secretive about what those plans are.

[h2]The Voz Dynasty[/h2]

As for the Voz Dynasty, they are having their own troubles getting into the region. They have their own name for the region. Their name for the mist was the Mai Cin Abin -- The Devourer. Now that the mists have retreated, they call the region Kursiyin Wofi, or The Empty Throne.

For ages, the Singhan Roots were a force multiplier that the Voz Dynasty didn't have an answer to. Their forces had to endure the trials and tribulations of long forced marches to get to the front line. The Sable Dynasty could have fresh, well-rested troops brought in from the coast to defend their fortress city a day after their leave ended. Several centuries of war have seen the creation of the nightmare of the No-Mans Land and a fragile peace that hangs on nothing new upsetting the balance.

As for the Voz Dynasty itself, it is a strange kingdom -- for it is nearly cut in half by the Kashin Baya. Before the mist disappeared it formed an impenetrable wall that extended from the Kashin Baya to the Obsi Takobin, a mountain range even larger and more dangerous than the Kashin Baya. There are myths and legends about these two mountain ranges in the Voz Dynasty, for these arrow straight mountains have hemmed in the Mutanen people since they first settled the region a long, long time ago. However, as they grew, they eventually found where the Kashin Baya turn to hills, then to a great prairie.

Before the Voz Dynasty, the Mutanen people lived harsh and short lives in the rocky desert of their homeland. When the first Khan Emperor pushed the boundary of their land further East, he found where the Kashin Baya turns to praries. If not for an unfortunate comment at a trade summit, the Mutanen would most likely become nomads in the vast grass sea of the Giya Dery. However, the past played out as it did and forged the Mutanen into the Voz Dynasty who expanded their kingdom a ways before the kingdoms on their border were able to halt their spread. That is, until the Voz Dynasty found the first of a handful of routes through the Kashin Baya, straight into the heart of one of the kingdoms who had stopped their spread. Over the next few centuries, the Voz Dynasty spent their time looking for a new pass, or some numenera that would grant them passage straight through them ountains.

They found several, each time kicking off a new age in their calandar.

The Voz Dynasty marks the years in the number of years since the last conquest for expansion. Each Age is named for the warlord who led their hordes as they begain the conquest of a new land. The first Age of the Voz Dynasty begain when they spilled out into the prairies. The next five came as they found ways over or through the Kashin Baya and were able to further expand their empire. The most recent age, the "Era of the Emberglade Igniter" ( also know as the "Era of the Timeless Failure" for reasons not gone into here ) the Voz Dynasty encountered the Sable Hegemony. And for three centuries the two kingdoms fought to a standstil. On the eastern edge of the Void Forest lays the result of that time of war, No-Mans Land.

However, the Voz Dynasty also borders Maka-Tho. The eastern edge of the mists marked the western boundary of the desert the war riders of the Voz Dynasty call home. More superstitious than their Hegemony enemies, they too were troubled by the disappearance of the mists. Some claimed that it was merely a trick ( either from the gods or from the Hegemony ), that sending their men into Maka-Tho would cause the mists to return and eat the entire army.

Along the thousands of kilometers that make up the Kashin Baya, there is only one pass you can march an army through without having to spend days on the other side waiting for straglers. The Grey Sea. For ages, the people of Calda thought the Grey Sea to be nothing more than an oddity. A strange patch of land that lead to a wall of pink mist that would kill you.

But now the mist is gone, and some people in Calda wonder if some day they will receive word that the Voz Dynasty has broken through the Grey Sea and into the heart of Calda.

For now the people of Calda can sleep soundly. The land of the Voz Dynasty that bordered the Maka-Tho mists was sparsely populated desert for a reason: it is some of the toughest land in the entire Voz Dynasty to live in. It's the birthplace of their first emperor, and most of the Ruwan Dare. As they try to explore the lands uncovered by the disappearance of the mist, the Voz Dynasty has to come to terms with the fact that they are not explorers but warriors. So they make slow progress in their travels through this new land, hampered by the fact that most travel as armies instead of light and nible scouting units.

There are obstacles that stand in their way, but the Mutanen are hardy people. The Voz Dynasty knows that one day soon they will have a way to bring their armies through Maka-Tho and into the heartland of their hated enemies. They may even find a numenera or two that negates the Singhan Roots. Someone who could do that would learn that the generosity of the Burkham Khaan -- the God of Khans, ruler of the Voz Dynasty -- can be great and bountiful.
