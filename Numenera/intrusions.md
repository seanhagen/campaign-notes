Intrusions
==========

These are suggestions of intrusions to use in various scenarios.

# Cyphers or Artefacts
Not all GM intrusions, even those triggered by a roll of 1 on the die, should be
fumbles or malfunctions. A GM intrusion can be anything that potentially changes
the course of the action or the storyline. However, when the intrusion involves
the numenera, sometimes a malfunction is in order. Here are some suggestions:

• The device triggers its effect on an unintended target.

• The device’s effect is reversed, if possible. A restorative effect becomes
damaging. An attack becomes something that aids or heals.

• The device’s effect is triggered in an unexpected or undesirable way. The user
is not in control of the device. A belt that grants the ability to hover sends
the wearer careening off in a random direction, probably to crash into a wall or
the floor. A ray emitter fires wildly or explodes. An injector sprays its
contents into the user’s eye, causing pain and temporary blindness.

• The device explodes, inflicting damage equal to its level on all within
immediate range.

• The device reaches out telepathically and obeys the commands of another
creature within long range instead of the commands of the user.

• The device inexplicably sprouts metallic, spiderlike legs and scurries away,
never to be seen again.

• The device negates gravity in immediate range for one round.

• The device releases a pulse that stuns everyone in immediate range for one
round, during which they can take no action.

• Energy feeds back into the user, who suffers damage equal to the device’s
level.

• The device and 1d6 other nearby devices are permanently depowered.

• The device loses all power, but another device within long range gains extra
power.

• A spatial warp is created, leading to a place very far away (or another
universe entirely). It remains open for only a few rounds.

• The device gains intelligence and telepathic abilities and wishes to negotiate
with the user in order to activate.

• All within immediate range are filled with irrational fear for one round and
flee at top speed.

• The device fuses with one or two other devices in the user’s possession and
becomes an entirely new artifact.
