There are always abhumans about in the Ninth World, or visitants who are less than friendly.

Are some who lived in Maka-Tho upset about the mists disappearing? Are they upset that humans are encroaching on their land, land that might have been theirs for hundreds of years?

The territorial creatures that live in Maka-Tho are probably also not happy about humans. Ager already dealt with the few who considered the hill the ship lay within as their territory. However, there are other creatures who may come and try to take the hill and the surrounding grasslands for themselves. Prey animals have migrated to the now safer area near Ararholm, or their herds have grown thanks to decreased predation. What will come to investigate the bountiful feast, and how will it react to the humans of Ararholm?

There are other creatures to consider as well. Not only are there creatures who prey upon humans, there are other things out there. Maybe something will get attracted to the ship to feed on the rare minerals within or upon whatever still powers it. Then there are the creatures which are attracted to the power and energy given off by numenera. Is Ararholm becoming a beacon of energies too delicious for some creature from another reality to ignore?
