Pamki is now twenty eight, and while she does her best to guide the town towards
her father's vison she knows that she is not the person her father was. Despite
spending his early life a glaive, many came to consider him more of an arkus --
a man of vision and charisma who shaped the town from nothing.

Spending most of her time these days stuck behind a desk in her family home,
Pamki still finds time to go down into the ship. Through corridors shown to her
by her father, she spends time at the console of the machine intelligence. While
she's never sure she'll fully trust it, at the very least it seems to understand
something of her position. She's not sure she'd call them friends, but what else
would you call the being you've shared most of your secrets with?
