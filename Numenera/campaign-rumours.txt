- The size of the "village" at the tree in the Grey Sea never changes -- the people that live there aren't actually human, they're facimilies created by the tree. When one dies they're taken to the crown of the tree, and then a few years later that person is alive again, living a simple life among the branches. Nobody who joins the tree village ever leaves.


robot rumors on the ship:
- However, there are stories of machines that roam the halls of the ship that
should you encounter them, your only recourse is to run. Machines that are only
whispered of in stories around campfires. Many new explorers think these just
fanciful tales, thinking it's just a tall tale to scare them away from the best
parts of the ship. The old timers keep their secrets though, and many wonder if
friends that never came back up lost their lives to the dread machine that
stalks the halls.
