- The size of the "village" at the tree in the Grey Sea never changes -- the people that live there aren't actually human, they're facimilies created by the tree. When one dies they're taken to the crown of the tree, and then a few years later that person is alive again, living a simple life among the branches. Nobody who joins the tree village ever leaves.
