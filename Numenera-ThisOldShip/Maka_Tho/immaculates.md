The Immaculates
===============

A group of worshipers that think their god is somewhere in Maka-Tho, waiting to
be released upon the world. Their god is the "White Prince", a being of power
and majesty. 

Only problem?

They think this god will wipe the planet of all other life and grant them
incredible powers and immortality. 

They're not good people.

## Known Members

Ghoka's second-in-command was actually a mid-ranking member of the order, using
Ghoka to try and find the resting site of the White Prince.
