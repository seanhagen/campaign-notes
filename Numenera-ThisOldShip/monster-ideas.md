Monsters & Ideas For Them
=========================

A place to jot down ideas for creatures, or ideas on how to use creatures I've
found.

## Kanthid
- a nano infecting a grave yard to try and get information from a deceased rival

## Llaric Scorpion
- make it small, and a small group of them is causing trouble for a
  village/homestead/place 
  
## Odlark
- use some!

things to be glimpsed in visions, probably not fought:

-- something that appears to be a floating orb, but the orb is actually the
shadow of the thing on the ground ( huzzah for mucking about with physics )

-- eldritch abominations:

"The Final Destination spin-off book Dead Reckoning has the main character Jess
enter what appears to be Death's realm in a dream. There she encounters what is
presumably Death's true form - the vaguely humanoid Death is gigantic, composed
of constantly shifting, crumbling, and regenerating bones from seemingly "every
creature that ever lived", and is covered in what could be loosely described as
robes made from what appears to be still living flesh that twitches and
squirms. From afar, it just looks like a dark mass, and it's constantly emitting
a noise that sounds like static and "thousands of birds all taking flight at the
same time", while its eyes are completely blank, dark voids. Also, anything in
proximity of it ages rapidly."



-- potential location: garden of eden
  --> further idea: maka-tho is the graveyard of the gods ( and some aren't so
  dead )
  
"Though demons rarely get physical description in the Bible (being mostly evil
spirits capable of disturbing and possessing humans), the Kabbalah offers a lot
more variety of physical forms, ranging from angry, ravenous crows that spread
like fire, to enormous, black giants covered with serpents, to disembodied,
veiled heads with glimpses of horrifying eyes."


"Though they're generally agreed to not be physical beings so much as
metaphorically-described human empires, the four beasts seen by the eponymous
prophet in chapter 7 of Daniel probably deserve mention here. They dominate the
world one after another; the first resembling a winged lion with the heart of a
human, the second a colossal bear that feeds on human flesh, the third a leopard
with four heads and four wings (and in some interpretations, draws on a variety
of big cats, as well), but the most eldritch of them all is the last one, which
is notably not described as looking like any Earthly animal. It is described as
having enormous claws, teeth made of iron, and ten horns which are the ten kings
that rule the empire that the whole beast represents. In addition, the
creature's smallest and most innocuous horn is strongly implied to be the most
powerful and evil world leader the Earth will ever know. This thing is
prophesied to singlehandedly rip the planet to shreds, and it ultimately takes
God Himself to finally kill it at the end of the world."

just a lot in here:

-- temples where people pray AGAINST god(s)
 -- people who are immortal without infinite youth, are basically skeletons
 forever praying
 
 "Silla of Inuit Mythology and most of its variations recognized by related
 cultures. Basically it is the air every thing breathes and the main ingredient
 of everything's soul. It is not exactly benevolent either as it wants those
 parts of itself that make up all that lives back, to the point it will convince
 kids to wander out into the tundra where they will freeze to death. It will not
 be completely satisfied until there is no more breathing."
