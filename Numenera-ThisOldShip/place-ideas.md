Place & Scene Ideas
===================

## Strange Staircase 

It's a staircase like the bone staircase in Maya & The Three when they enter the
underworld

## Seeing in 4D

From [the "You Cannot Grasp The True Form" on TV
Tropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotGraspTheTrueForm),
specifically one of the points from the "Real World" section:

If you could see yourself in the fourth dimension, you'd look like a huge worm
made of every single version of yourself from every moment across your entire
life. There would be your embryo at one end and your deceased self at the
other. All of this is without getting into the idea of branching pathways.
