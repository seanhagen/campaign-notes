Character Ideas
===============

A spot to doodle and daydream about characters.



### Religious Person

This quote from the Dune appendix speaks to me: 
"Religion must remain an outlet for people who say to themselves, “I am not the
kind of person I want to be.” It must never sink into an assemblage of the
self-satisfied."

Need a deeply religious and spiritual NPC who embodies this idea.
