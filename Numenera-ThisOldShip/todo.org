*** DONE scenario 1: in town (ghoka)
CLOSED: [2021-10-29 Fri 15:45]
handed out by: mex, sherrif, or pamki

someone has stolen supplies from the warehouse. the sheriff thinks it was one
of ghoka's men. he's got a lot of things on his plate, so if someone can
investigate and either find the stolen goods or find evidence of who stole
them.

a box of amber crystal was taken. these are crystals that are used in
self-repair numenera, or in numenera that float.

**** DONE design mystery [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-10-16 Sat 23:35]
***** DONE who stole the amber crystal [8/10]
CLOSED: [2021-10-16 Sat 23:33]
the same thief who stole from pamki. not one of ghoka's men, but figured that if
they followed one of ghoka's men to his hideout if the ruin was big enough he
could lay low there and hope that anyone who followed would figure it was ghoka.

clues:

in warehouse
- [X] the thief only took the box, nothing else was disturbed
- [ ] a box in warehouse has green thread on it from a cloak
- [X] a bit of powder near the box, a product kind of like snuff called "quick"
  commmon to glaives who used to be part of the army, herbalist or general
  store proprietor might know who buys that stuff
- [ ] a discarded and dead cypher near the door to the warehouse can be found, a
  successful check will show it would have made the door insubstantial for about
  5 minutes (not enough time for someone to ransack the warehouse, they had to
  know what they were looking for was in that particular warehouse and what it
  looked like)
- [X] one of the mugs from the tavern is sitting on a barrel near the warehouse,
  tavern keeper will remember who took it (a man in a green cloak, who
- [X] near the mug will be a partially eaten bit of "street meat", sold by
  Dibbler, a strange little man who sells what he claims is meat in the town
  square in the evenings and nights ( he doesn't wake up until noon at the
  earliest, he's usually up until nearly dawn trying to sell his "meat" to
  drunks leaving the tavern ( they're the only folks who will buy his
  stuff... cause they're drunk and hungry and the canteen is closed )

tavern:
- [X] can easily find stories about the "adventuring corporation" getting in a
  fight with some of ghoka's men about a previous run-in in a ruin -- more
  checking into this (other people, etc) will reveal that the run-in was in or
  near ghoka's hideout
- [X] the inn keeper will share a rumor told to him by one of his patrons after
  the fight, he heard one of the green cloaks suggesting they frame ghoka

around town:
- [X] one of the townsfolk will see someone wearing a green cloak sneaking out
  of the warehouse late last night ( ghoka hates that color )
- [X] another townsperson saw a small group of adventurers head out well after
  midnight (after the brawl and the theft), they were all wearing green cloaks

***** DONE where did they go
CLOSED: [2021-10-16 Sat 23:33]
went to hide out in the ruin that ghoka uses as his hideout ( his plan was to
follow one of ghokas men, if they were in a ruin then try to find somewhere else
in that ruin to hide and hope he's not found so they'll pin it on ghoka; if it
wasn't a ruin was just going to keep going after sneaking through the camp and
hoping that their trail would get lost in the camp

***** DONE why did they steal
CLOSED: [2021-10-16 Sat 23:34]
saw the wright buying it from a merchant for a lot of shins, thought it was
super valuable -- but mex has been waiting for this for a while, she paid extra
as thanks to the merchant for getting it so quickly

took the stuff from pamki because they saw it being handed over by a group that
came out of the ship, figured if pamki wanted the numenera then they must be
valuable ( not having gone into the ship, didn't realize that there's a tithe of
numenera recovered from within the ship )

***** DONE design ruin of where they're hiding
CLOSED: [2021-10-16 Sat 23:16]
***** DONE don't forget, lots of cluuuuuuuues
CLOSED: [2021-10-16 Sat 23:35]
if players get stuck:
- another one of the green cloaks tries to bribe them
- a few of the green cloaks attack them when they leave town
- one of ghoka's men will offer to sell them info on the thief
*** DONE scenario 2: in town (wright)
CLOSED: [2021-10-17 Sun 11:46]
the wright needs iotum to build some healing numenera to help some homesteading
families that are sick. unfortunately, they're completely out of the ones they
need to complete their project.

they've heard rumors of a ruin in the area that may have the materials they
require; the rumors she heard described some symbols she's seen before on
healing numenera

if someone can retrieve the iotum and bring them to the wright, there will
probably be some leftover healing cyphers they can give out

they sent Bryok Ede about a week ago, he hasn't returned.

iotum is in chamber 12

*** STARTED scenario 3: in town (pamki)
  pamki needs someone to go into the ship and fix the water supply. either fix
  whatever broke and is fouling the water, or stop the water completely -- the
  poison is getting into the ground water table and causing issues for nearby
  farms.

- to get to the area of the ship they need to get to, there's a door they need
  to pass through that's protected by a strong force field. a holographic
  assistant will inform them that secure areas of the ship are off limits to
  passengers, and that they should inform the steward if they feel there is an
  issue
  - alternate routes?
  - use the ring to turn off the force field ( same ring that opens the ship,
    pamki has it, if they get the ring then have them meet the ship AI )
*** DONE scenario 4: in town (pamki)
CLOSED: [2021-10-16 Sat 23:43]
  someone has stolen some old numenera and some personal items that belonged to
ager. pamki needs someone to find out who stole them and return the numenera.

  while pamki is normally somewhat shy and quiet, she becomes angry and animated
when talking about this. whatever was stolen was important.

**** DONE what was stolen
CLOSED: [2021-10-16 Sat 23:43]
 - the numenera:
  - hanging cocoon (level 5)
  - habiliment mirage (level 5)

*** DONE scenario 5: near town (sheriff)
CLOSED: [2021-11-06 Sat 17:11]
- the sheriff knows that ghoka has found somewhere else to set up camp. sheriff
  is worried that it's a ruin where ghoka will find something that will give him
  a deadly edge against the town.

  he's heard rumours about where the ruin is.

  what the sheriff knows:
  - when ghoka leaves he's going south, but could be doubling back
  - rumor: that ruin ghoka is using has a secret entrance
  - rumor: ghoka keeps something in the ruin that he uses to punish gang members
    that step out of line

  ghoka is smart, the ruin is actually to the west.

  ghoka keeps a xacorocax inside the ruin, in a pit. he throws gang members that
  fail him into the pit, if they can survive for ten minutes a rope is thrown in
  ( they still have to manage to climb out on their own, though )

  when the players reach the room with the pit, they'll see Leverett Stamper
  getting pushed into the pit and dying to the xacorocax. he'll show up in town
  a month later

forest name: grey woods
- there's a small forest near the town, only a few acres, but it'll provide
  enough wood to keep the woodworker in enough wood for the next few projects
  he's got planned.

  however, the second to last person he sent to scout the wood came back
  claiming there were demons. the last person he sent didn't make it back.

  he needs someone to either make those woods safe, or to find him another acre
  of woods. he'd prefer this forest, the trees there have particularly hard and
  strong wood.

*** STARTED scenario 7: far from town (pamki)
  word has reached pamki that a caravan bringing food & building materials
has gotten lost somewhere between the city of the dead and ararholm.

  pamki would like someone to go and find the caravan and guide it to

CLOSED: [2021-12-04 Sat 11:51] DEADLINE: <2021-12-05 Sun>

Ager's notes on the ship in the ruins, talks about Neta ( but not as an AI, like
she's just someone he met while exploring the ship ), tells Pamki where to find
one in his belongings, has notes on the crystals required from scanrios 2,3,5, &
7, as well as musings on where the other two crystals could be.

Ager thinks the two crystals he hadn't found could be in one of these places:
- inside a ruin in the impenetrable forest to the south-east
- inside a ruin in the dead forest to the south
- inside a ruin in the desert mesas
- inside a ruin in the red forest

His notes say he hopes they're not in the fungi forest to the north-west, or
across the river. The fungi forest does strange things to a person's mind, and
the river is treacherous (lots of rapids and rocky sections, plus plenty of
dangerous creatures call the river home and are somewhat territorial)

----

it's clothing made from a special material (war moth silk, spun steelglass,
airfoam, bracarfi (braided carbon fiber), etc) that provides extra
benefits. usually something like easing speed/might/intellect defense by one
step, or protecting better against ranged/melee/esoteries/elements/etc

Two mods, one for each arm.

Can be implanted within mechanical arms to provide the following benefits:

Upon activation ( requires an action ) , can form the splinters into one of the
following:
 - A forearm blade that functions as a normal sword that does 4 points of
   damage; any tasks requiring the use of the users hands is hindered by one step
 - A single long whip-like strand with the Reach & Entangle property, 6 points
   of damage
 - A cloud of 30 small metallic splinters that float in a cloud around your
   arms. Adds 1 point of damage to any unarmed melee attacks, but damages any
   items held within your hands every round.

   As an action, can fire 5 splinters at any creature within short range to
   inflict 5 points of damage that bypasses armor.

   By spending Might effort another 5 splinters can be fired for an additional 5
   points of damage ( also bypassing armor ). You can expend effort to increase
   the number of splinters up to a maximum of 30 splinters doing 30 points of
   damage. All splinters are fired as a single action, so only one ranged attack
   roll is required.

   Once fired, splinters must be retrieved by touching the body or central mass
   of where the splinters hit. Unrecoverable splinters regenerate at a rate of 5/day.
***** Notes
Mex will have mentioned to Zeno that she thinks there may be alternate weapon
forms that can be unlocked, the sword was apparently one of a larger "set" of
weapons. Each weapon had a control crystal of some kind, Mex simply unlocked a
little bit more of what the sword could do.

*** DONE bracers for Ureos
CLOSED: [2022-02-05 Sat 15:53]
**** Jeweled Dancer's Bracers, Level 4
A set of bracers, artfully carved with scenes of dancers & musicians. Set into
the bracers are a number precious metals, with bits of wire, shiny metal
baubles, & fragments of glass or crystals. As the user moves their arms, the
bracers catch and reflect light in strange ways. The hanging bits can produce a
rhythmic, almost drum-like sound if the user is skilled enough.

These shiny bits can be used to great effect by someone dexterous & skilled
enough. Meant to be worn by skilled dancers or storytellers as an aid to their
craft. The various bits

Can be activated ( requires an action ) to produce one of the following actions:
 - attempt to stun all other creatures within immediate range with lights & sounds
 - attempt to inspire one allied creature for the next turn, easing all tasks by
   one step

By spending a level of effort, you can choose one of the following additional
effects:
 - the range of the effect can be increased to short range
 - the difficulty of the check to stun or inspire is decreased by one step

By spending two levels of effort, you can get both additional effects.
***** Notes
Mex lets Ureos know that she thinks that some of the original pieces were lost
over the years and replaced with inferior components. There may be pieces of
lost technology she can use to improve the bracers; anything that deals with
resonance or acoustics may have bits she can use to improve the bracers.

*** DONE buckler shield for Klep
CLOSED: [2022-02-05 Sat 15:53]

**** Probabilistic Crystal Shield, Level 4
A buckler shield seemingly made from a mostly clear crystal with milky strands
of a strange mineral running through the crystal. When worn, looking through the
crystal provides glimpses into possible futures.

Provides 1 points of armor while worn, and eases Speed defense tasks by one step.

Can be activated to produce one of the following effects, once per day:

 - Create a flash of light that gifts a confusing sense of foresight to a
   creature you choose within short range. All of that creatures attacks are
   hindered, while all attacks against them are eased for two rounds as they try
   to figure out which hazy image is their real attacker.
 - Create a flash of light that gifts a gentle sense of foresight to a creature
   you choose within short range. All of that creatures attacks are eased, while
   all attacks against them are hindered for two rounds as the shield grants
   them the ability to see a moment into the most likely future.
 - Cause the shield to shine brightly on an object or creature, allowing you to
   divine one thing about its future. You may ask a single yes-or-no question of
   the GM who must answer truthfully; but it must be about something that
   happens to that you could feasibly see from where you current stand. For
   example, you can ask if a candle will get lit -- but you'll only know the
   answer if the candle is lit before it's moved.
***** Notes
Mex tells Klep that she thinks there may be other crystals ( or whatever they
actually are ) out there she could incorporate into the armor. She does mention
that the crystals have something to do with the Vex, which she doesn't know much about.

*** DONE bracer/shield for Belel
CLOSED: [2022-02-05 Sat 15:53]
**** Black Leather Bracers, Level 4
A single bracer meant to be worn on the dominant arm.

Can be activated ( requires an action ) to produce a buckler shield of smoke and
darkness. This shield harnesses Belel's innate gifts, and so won't work for
anyone else.

The shadow buckler shield provides 1 points of armor, and eases Speed defense
tasks by one.

By expending a point of effort, you can increase the size of the shield from the
size of a buckler shield to that of a kite shield, providing an additional point
of armor.

If you expend a further level of effort the shield becomes a wall of darkness
with a surface area no greater than 50 square feet -- so a wall 10 feet wide and
5 feet high ( or 5 feet wide and 10 feet high ) or anything you can imagine so
long as it's no bigger than 50 sq ft.

The fully expanded shield hinders any attempts to perceive what is on the other
side ( regardless of what side you're on ). Attempting to pass through the
shield wall produces a cold and empty feeling. The user of the bracer can choose
to require an Intellect check for those attempting to pass through, on a failure
they take 2 points of Intellect damage and fail to pass through the wall.

The shield is attached to the bracer and can only be powered by
Belel. Basically, if Belel moves the shield moves.

***** Notes
Mex tells Belel that she thinks that with the right pieces of tech she should be
able to make it so the bracer can keep the shield "real" while being detached
from the bracer, potentially allowing Belel to place the shield as a barricade,
or use the buckler form as a ranged weapon.

*** DONE pair of bracer/gloves for Fox
CLOSED: [2022-02-05 Sat 15:55]
**** Stone Bracers, Level 4
A pair of bracers that ease all melee defense tasks by 1 step.

Can be activated ( requires an action ) to provide the following benefits:

 - Your arms from finger tips to mid-biceps turns into a stone-like
   substance. It doesn't hinder your movement or dexterity at all, however it
   does give you an additional 1 armor against melee attacks.
 - While you have stone arms, your grip strength is increased dramatically,
   easing any tasks requiring grip strength ( climbing, disarming opponents, etc
   ) is eased by one
 - You can spend a level of effort to increase the density of your arms, which
   gives you 2 points of armor piercing for unarmed attacks

However, for each hour that your arms are in stone form you lose a point of
Might as the gauntlets work to try and prevent the stone form of your arms from
becoming actual stone.
***** Notes
Mex tells Fox that with the right data & samples she might be able to tune the
gauntlets to provide one of the following benefits:

 - change the type of stone ( may add a damage bonus, or other features )
 - reduce or eliminate the health drain
