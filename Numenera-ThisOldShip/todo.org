*** DONE scenario 1: in town (ghoka)
CLOSED: [2021-10-29 Fri 15:45]
handed out by: mex, sherrif, or pamki

someone has stolen supplies from the warehouse. the sheriff thinks it was one
of ghoka's men. he's got a lot of things on his plate, so if someone can
investigate and either find the stolen goods or find evidence of who stole
them.

a box of amber crystal was taken. these are crystals that are used in
self-repair numenera, or in numenera that float.

**** DONE design mystery [100%]
CLOSED: [2021-10-16 Sat 23:35]
***** DONE who stole the amber crystal [8/10]
CLOSED: [2021-10-16 Sat 23:33]
the same thief who stole from pamki. not one of ghoka's men, but figured that if
they followed one of ghoka's men to his hideout if the ruin was big enough he
could lay low there and hope that anyone who followed would figure it was ghoka.

clues:

in warehouse
- [X] the thief only took the box, nothing else was disturbed
- [ ] a box in warehouse has green thread on it from a cloak
- [X] a bit of powder near the box, a product kind of like snuff called "quick"
  commmon to glaives who used to be part of the army, herbalist or general
  store proprietor might know who buys that stuff
- [ ] a discarded and dead cypher near the door to the warehouse can be found, a
  successful check will show it would have made the door insubstantial for about
  5 minutes (not enough time for someone to ransack the warehouse, they had to
  know what they were looking for was in that particular warehouse and what it
  looked like)
- [X] one of the mugs from the tavern is sitting on a barrel near the warehouse,
  tavern keeper will remember who took it (a man in a green cloak, who
- [X] near the mug will be a partially eaten bit of "street meat", sold by
  Dibbler, a strange little man who sells what he claims is meat in the town
  square in the evenings and nights ( he doesn't wake up until noon at the
  earliest, he's usually up until nearly dawn trying to sell his "meat" to
  drunks leaving the tavern ( they're the only folks who will buy his
  stuff... cause they're drunk and hungry and the canteen is closed )

tavern:
- [X] can easily find stories about the "adventuring corporation" getting in a
  fight with some of ghoka's men about a previous run-in in a ruin -- more
  checking into this (other people, etc) will reveal that the run-in was in or
  near ghoka's hideout
- [X] the inn keeper will share a rumor told to him by one of his patrons after
  the fight, he heard one of the green cloaks suggesting they frame ghoka

around town:
- [X] one of the townsfolk will see someone wearing a green cloak sneaking out
  of the warehouse late last night ( ghoka hates that color )
- [X] another townsperson saw a small group of adventurers head out well after
  midnight (after the brawl and the theft), they were all wearing green cloaks

***** DONE where did they go
CLOSED: [2021-10-16 Sat 23:33]
went to hide out in the ruin that ghoka uses as his hideout ( his plan was to
follow one of ghokas men, if they were in a ruin then try to find somewhere else
in that ruin to hide and hope he's not found so they'll pin it on ghoka; if it
wasn't a ruin was just going to keep going after sneaking through the camp and
hoping that their trail would get lost in the camp

***** DONE why did they steal
CLOSED: [2021-10-16 Sat 23:34]
saw the wright buying it from a merchant for a lot of shins, thought it was
super valuable -- but mex has been waiting for this for a while, she paid extra
as thanks to the merchant for getting it so quickly

took the stuff from pamki because they saw it being handed over by a group that
came out of the ship, figured if pamki wanted the numenera then they must be
valuable ( not having gone into the ship, didn't realize that there's a tithe of
numenera recovered from within the ship )

***** DONE design ruin of where they're hiding
CLOSED: [2021-10-16 Sat 23:16]
***** DONE don't forget, lots of cluuuuuuuues
CLOSED: [2021-10-16 Sat 23:35]
if players get stuck:
- another one of the green cloaks tries to bribe them
- a few of the green cloaks attack them when they leave town
- one of ghoka's men will offer to sell them info on the thief
*** DONE scenario 2: in town (wright)
CLOSED: [2021-10-17 Sun 11:46]
the wright needs iotum to build some healing numenera to help some homesteading
families that are sick. unfortunately, they're completely out of the ones they
need to complete their project.

they've heard rumors of a ruin in the area that may have the materials they
require; the rumors she heard described some symbols she's seen before on
healing numenera

if someone can retrieve the iotum and bring them to the wright, there will
probably be some leftover healing cyphers they can give out

they sent Bryok Ede about a week ago, he hasn't returned.

iotum is in chamber 12

the ruin, preferably a pack
*** STARTED scenario 3: in town (pamki)
  pamki needs someone to go into the ship and fix the water supply. either fix
  whatever broke and is fouling the water, or stop the water completely -- the
  poison is getting into the ground water table and causing issues for nearby
  farms.
  
**** STARTED build the ship "entrance hall"
the parts of the ship that are well known and fully explored

**** TODO fill out scenario outline with descriptions
**** TODO build the part of the ship that contains the broken equipment
need:
- [ ] broken machine that's fouling the water
- [ ] the machine that produces or pumps the water

**** TODO the twist
- to get to the area of the ship they need to get to, there's a door they need
  to pass through that's protected by a strong force field. a holographic
  assistant will inform them that secure areas of the ship are off limits to
  passengers, and that they should inform the steward if they feel there is an
  issue
  - alternate routes?
  - use the ring to turn off the force field ( same ring that opens the ship,
    pamki has it, if they get the ring then have them meet the ship AI )

*** DONE scenario 4: in town (pamki)
CLOSED: [2021-10-16 Sat 23:43]
  someone has stolen some old numenera and some personal items that belonged to
ager. pamki needs someone to find out who stole them and return the numenera.

  while pamki is normally somewhat shy and quiet, she becomes angry and animated
when talking about this. whatever was stolen was important.

**** DONE what was stolen
CLOSED: [2021-10-16 Sat 23:43]
- the numenera:
  - hanging cocoon (level 5)
  - habiliment mirage (level 5)

  - one of her father's journals

in ghoka's hideout, they're one of the explorers in chamber 8
*** STARTED scenario 5: near town (sheriff)
- the sheriff knows that ghoka has found somewhere else to set up camp. sheriff
  is worried that it's a ruin where ghoka will find something that will give him
  a deadly edge against the town.

  he's heard rumours about where the ruin is.

  what the sheriff knows:
  - when ghoka leaves he's going south, but could be doubling back
  - rumor: that ruin ghoka is using has a secret entrance
  - rumor: ghoka keeps something in the ruin that he uses to punish gang members
    that step out of line
     
  ghoka is smart, the ruin is actually to the west.

  ghoka keeps a xacorocax inside the ruin, in a pit. he throws gang members that
  fail him into the pit, if they can survive for ten minutes a rope is thrown in
  ( they still have to manage to climb out on their own, though )

  when the players reach the room with the pit, they'll see Leverett Stamper
  getting pushed into the pit and dying to the xacorocax. he'll show up in town
  a month later

*** STARTED scenario 6: near town (wood worker)
forest name: grey woods
- there's a small forest near the town, only a few acres, but it'll provide
  enough wood to keep the woodworker in enough wood for the next few projects
  he's got planned.

  however, the second to last person he sent to scout the wood came back
  claiming there were demons. the last person he sent didn't make it back.

  he needs someone to either make those woods safe, or to find him another acre
  of woods. he'd prefer this forest, the trees there have particularly hard and
  strong wood.

*** STARTED scenario 7: far from town (pamki)
  word has reached pamki that a caravan bringing food & building materials
has gotten lost somewhere between the city of the dead and ararholm.

  pamki would like someone to go and find the caravan and guide it to
ararholm. while they need the food and materials, she's mostly concerned about
the caravan -- the trader is an old friend of hers, and she wants to make sure
they're safe.
