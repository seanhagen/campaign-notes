* Notes
** Thinking About Wilderness Travel
[[https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/43899/roleplaying-games/thinking-about-wilderness-travel][page]]

- don't try to do a hexcrawl unless it's what the players specifically want
*** basic travel routes
**** choose your route
- PCs must choose the route
- they can only do this if they're /aware/ of what routes they could use
- they can get that info from: maps, local guides, mystical assistance, personal experience
- if they don't have /any/ info on potential routes, then they will need to do
  some exploring (ie, a hexcrawl or similar structure)
- there has to be meaningful differences between routes
- common differences between routes are: speed, difficulty, stealth (example:
  taking the high road means you'll be spotted by the army), expense (a ship
  might be quicker but will cost way more than just walking), advantageous
  landmarks (a route that passes through a town or something could be better
  than trudging through the wilderness), hazards
- for the choice to be an actual _choice_ and not just a _calculation_, routes
  should be distinguished by at least two incomparable characteristics

a good example is [[https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/dnd/resources/Sword-Coast-Map_HighRes.jpg][the journey from waterdeep to neverwinter]]

> You look at the map and say, “You can take the High Road or you can travel by sea.”
>
> “What’s the difference?” they ask.
>
> “Well,” you say, “You’ll get there faster by sea.”
>
> This is not a choice. It’s a simple calculation: The routes are identical
>  except for the speed with which they’ll get you to Neverwinter, and so you take
>  the route which is faster.
>
> But if you instead say, “Well, it’s faster to sail, but there are reports of
>  Moonshae pirates hitting ships along the coast,” this is no longer a simple
>  calculation. The PCs have to choose whether speed or safety is more important
>  to them.

- one solid set of incomparable distinctions is all i should need
- can add more, but beware of turning the choice back into a calculation:
  - sea route is faster and is dangerous due to pirates
  - road is dangerous due to the hazards of the mere of dead men
- both are dangerous now, and one is faster -- it's a calculation again
- although if they're not able to infer the relative hazard of either route it
  becomes an 'incomplete information problem' -- still not good, as the players
  will probably assume they're equally dangerous
- PCs have to /care/ about the distinction, as well -- if either route will get
  them there before their deadline then speed isn't really a factor
**** traveling the route
- break the journey into a number of turns ( recommended multipler turns per
  day, so it's possible to have more than one encounter per day )
- use same timekeeping if campaign also has hexcrawling

three things to track in this procedure:
- *landmarks* such as permanent structures (cities, statues, etc) or "programmed"
  encounters just for this journey (broken-down wagon, an ambush by bandits,
  etc) but either way they'll be encountered at specific points along the route
- *random encounters* -- keep these tables simple unless it's a route they'll be
  traveling a lot
- *resources used* -- food, water, etc. this is optional, and for some types of
  trips it won't be relevant (paying for passage on a ship would include food &
  water, for example)

when traveling via a defined route, don't have to track distance traveled; it's
built into the design of the route.

if pcs take actions that change the speed of travel, you can apply that directly
to the route timetable
**** unpathed routes
most routes for this kind of travel will be a clear and unmistakable path -- a
road, a river, etc.

some routes don't follow paths. these generally take the form of a landmark
chain (head north till you reach village x, head east till you get to
<landmark>, then head south till...)

to handle unpathed routes, you'll need to add mechanics for both:
- getting lost
- getting back on track after you've become lost
- may need a mechanic to determine whether or not the pcs /realize/ they're lost
**** hidden route features
although pcs need to know enough to make an actual /choice/ about the route
they're going to take, they don't need to know everything

things can change that the pcs could never discover before setting out:
- a bridge has been washed out by a spring flood
- a bandit gang has moved into the area and is menacing travellers
- an army checkpoint has been abandoned due to being recalled for <reasons>

some hidden route features can be discovered ahead of time, but would require
the pcs putting in the work (researching the route, finding better maps, getting
info from someone who recently traveled that way, etc)
**** forked routes
sometimes a new route ( or routes ) can appear after the journey has begun; this
includes *detours*, which the fork will collapse back into the route they
initially chose

detours are often responses to hidden route features discovered during travel
(have to find a different way across the river because the bridge got washed
out, etc)

in addition to trying to avoid bad things on the original route, pcs may choose
a fork because it may provide a benefit (if they go south from the washed out
bridge there's a druid enclave that may have information and aid for the party)
*** running with routes
a few things to keep in mind when running a game with a route system

- this structure does not inherently make travel interesting
- if i think of the structure as a way to easily frame specific scenes
  (landmarks, random encounters, etc) then i still need to make the scenes
  themselves meaningful
- by default a route system will lead me into a generic travelogue ( we went to
  X then we went to Y then... ); the best travelogues find ways to elevate the
  sequence of events
- think about what kind of story the journey should be trying to tell:
  exploration, a race, escape, survival, edification, self-discovery, etc
- or is the journey just a convenient framing device for individually
  interesting and complete short stories?
- journeys can set a mood, emphasize a theme, establish current events, or
  provide hooks to side quests
- think about the *agenda* of the scenes i'm framing -- why am i framing those
  moments? what's the *bang* that forces the pcs to make one or more meaningful choices?
- if i can't think of an agenda or bang for a particular landmark, then consider
  demoting that landmark to part of the abstract description of the journey or
  even drop it entirely
- the truth is that the pcs will see *a lot* of stuff on the road, and i'm going
  to skip a bunch; the goal is to figure out the important stuff i /need/ to focus
  on in order for the journey to be meaningful
*** the problem with multiple routes
- route systems can too-easily become choose-your-own-adventure structures (ie,
  having to prep content for each potential route and then immediately throwing
  out all the content for the routes not chosen)

a few ways to mitigate this:

- try to have players decide the route they'll take at the _end_ of a session;
  still need to prep the details required for the party to make a choice, but
  then only the route chosen needs to be prepped in detail
- in many cases there may not be a choice, simply a _calculation_; if this is the
  case simply prep the route
- focus prep on *proactive elements* that are relevant regardless of the route
  chosen; being chased by bad guys is an easy example -- choosing between speed,
  safety, and stealth is more impactful when you're being chased, but you still
  only have to prep the bad guys *once*
- there's also content that the pcs bring with them; npcs, puzzles, etc
- and there's always ways to reuse & recycle material from one route for a later journey
*** final notes
at some point a map should be updated with routes and whatnot so that players
have an easy to reference document
