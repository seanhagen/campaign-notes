[h2]Vast Unexplored Territory[/h2]

The scale is a region that covers about the same patch of earth as what is now
covered by British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan -- roughly 2 million
square kilometers.

However, the area known to the players or characters at the start of the
campaign is small. Mostly the road from the Grey Sea to where Ararholm stands is
all they know.

There is a lot of frontier to explore out there.
