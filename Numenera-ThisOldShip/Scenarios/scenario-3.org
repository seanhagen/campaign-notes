notes:
 - sealed exits should require a key or something found in another ruin elsewhere
 - hidden exits, if not already leading somewhere, should lead to a small
   storage room with some cyphers and shins
 - unexplored exits should be treated like sealed exits, although the ship AI
   may have clues about where to find the keys

feature:

feature is broken, and is the reason for the water being fouled
 - it's a machine that did _something_ to the water
 - can be bypassed (level 5)
 - machine can be turned off (level 3), but that means no more waterfall in the village
 - if players want to fix the machine, they need parts (figure out a list, the
   wright should have some and know a good place to find the rest -- like the
   ruin they need the party to check out!)

this is where the broken piece of the ship is
