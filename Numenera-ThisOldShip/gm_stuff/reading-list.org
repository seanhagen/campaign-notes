* Notes
** Thinking About Wilderness Travel
[[https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/43899/roleplaying-games/thinking-about-wilderness-travel][page]]

- don't try to do a hexcrawl unless it's what the players specifically want
*** basic travel routes
**** choose your route
- PCs must choose the route
- they can only do this if they're /aware/ of what routes they could use
- they can get that info from: maps, local guides, mystical assistance, personal experience
- if they don't have /any/ info on potential routes, then they will need to do
  some exploring (ie, a hexcrawl or similar structure)
- there has to be meaningful differences between routes
- common differences between routes are: speed, difficulty, stealth (example:
  taking the high road means you'll be spotted by the army), expense (a ship
  might be quicker but will cost way more than just walking), advantageous
  landmarks (a route that passes through a town or something could be better
  than trudging through the wilderness), hazards
- for the choice to be an actual _choice_ and not just a _calculation_, routes
  should be distinguished by at least two incomparable characteristics

a good example is [[https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/dnd/resources/Sword-Coast-Map_HighRes.jpg][the journey from waterdeep to neverwinter]]

> You look at the map and say, “You can take the High Road or you can travel by sea.”
>
> “What’s the difference?” they ask.
>
> “Well,” you say, “You’ll get there faster by sea.”
>
> This is not a choice. It’s a simple calculation: The routes are identical
>  except for the speed with which they’ll get you to Neverwinter, and so you take
>  the route which is faster.
>
> But if you instead say, “Well, it’s faster to sail, but there are reports of
>  Moonshae pirates hitting ships along the coast,” this is no longer a simple
>  calculation. The PCs have to choose whether speed or safety is more important
>  to them.

- one solid set of incomparable distinctions is all i should need
- can add more, but beware of turning the choice back into a calculation:
  - sea route is faster and is dangerous due to pirates
  - road is dangerous due to the hazards of the mere of dead men
- both are dangerous now, and one is faster -- it's a calculation again
- although if they're not able to infer the relative hazard of either route it
  becomes an 'incomplete information problem' -- still not good, as the players
  will probably assume they're equally dangerous
- PCs have to /care/ about the distinction, as well -- if either route will get
  them there before their deadline then speed isn't really a factor
**** traveling the route
- break the journey into a number of turns ( recommended multipler turns per
  day, so it's possible to have more than one encounter per day )
- use same timekeeping if campaign also has hexcrawling

three things to track in this procedure:
- *landmarks* such as permanent structures (cities, statues, etc) or "programmed"
  encounters just for this journey (broken-down wagon, an ambush by bandits,
  etc) but either way they'll be encountered at specific points along the route
- *random encounters* -- keep these tables simple unless it's a route they'll be
  traveling a lot
- *resources used* -- food, water, etc. this is optional, and for some types of
  trips it won't be relevant (paying for passage on a ship would include food &
  water, for example)

when traveling via a defined route, don't have to track distance traveled; it's
built into the design of the route.

if pcs take actions that change the speed of travel, you can apply that directly
to the route timetable
**** unpathed routes
most routes for this kind of travel will be a clear and unmistakable path -- a
road, a river, etc.

some routes don't follow paths. these generally take the form of a landmark
chain (head north till you reach village x, head east till you get to
<landmark>, then head south till...)

to handle unpathed routes, you'll need to add mechanics for both:
- getting lost
- getting back on track after you've become lost
- may need a mechanic to determine whether or not the pcs /realize/ they're lost
**** hidden route features
although pcs need to know enough to make an actual /choice/ about the route
they're going to take, they don't need to know everything

things can change that the pcs could never discover before setting out:
- a bridge has been washed out by a spring flood
- a bandit gang has moved into the area and is menacing travellers
- an army checkpoint has been abandoned due to being recalled for <reasons>

some hidden route features can be discovered ahead of time, but would require
the pcs putting in the work (researching the route, finding better maps, getting
info from someone who recently traveled that way, etc)
**** forked routes
sometimes a new route ( or routes ) can appear after the journey has begun; this
includes *detours*, which the fork will collapse back into the route they
initially chose

detours are often responses to hidden route features discovered during travel
(have to find a different way across the river because the bridge got washed
out, etc)

in addition to trying to avoid bad things on the original route, pcs may choose
a fork because it may provide a benefit (if they go south from the washed out
bridge there's a druid enclave that may have information and aid for the party)
*** running with routes
a few things to keep in mind when running a game with a route system

- this structure does not inherently make travel interesting
- if i think of the structure as a way to easily frame specific scenes
  (landmarks, random encounters, etc) then i still need to make the scenes
  themselves meaningful
- by default a route system will lead me into a generic travelogue ( we went to
  X then we went to Y then... ); the best travelogues find ways to elevate the
  sequence of events
- think about what kind of story the journey should be trying to tell:
  exploration, a race, escape, survival, edification, self-discovery, etc
- or is the journey just a convenient framing device for individually
  interesting and complete short stories?
- journeys can set a mood, emphasize a theme, establish current events, or
  provide hooks to side quests
- think about the *agenda* of the scenes i'm framing -- why am i framing those
  moments? what's the *bang* that forces the pcs to make one or more meaningful choices?
- if i can't think of an agenda or bang for a particular landmark, then consider
  demoting that landmark to part of the abstract description of the journey or
  even drop it entirely
- the truth is that the pcs will see *a lot* of stuff on the road, and i'm going
  to skip a bunch; the goal is to figure out the important stuff i /need/ to focus
  on in order for the journey to be meaningful
*** the problem with multiple routes
- route systems can too-easily become choose-your-own-adventure structures (ie,
  having to prep content for each potential route and then immediately throwing
  out all the content for the routes not chosen)

a few ways to mitigate this:

- try to have players decide the route they'll take at the _end_ of a session;
  still need to prep the details required for the party to make a choice, but
  then only the route chosen needs to be prepped in detail
- in many cases there may not be a choice, simply a _calculation_; if this is the
  case simply prep the route
- focus prep on *proactive elements* that are relevant regardless of the route
  chosen; being chased by bad guys is an easy example -- choosing between speed,
  safety, and stealth is more impactful when you're being chased, but you still
  only have to prep the bad guys *once*
- there's also content that the pcs bring with them; npcs, puzzles, etc
- and there's always ways to reuse & recycle material from one route for a later journey
*** final notes
at some point a map should be updated with routes and whatnot so that players
have an easy to reference document

- [[https://detectmagic.blogspot.com/2014/04/pathcrawl.html][good noes on building pathcrawls here]]
- [[https://hillcantons.blogspot.com/2012/01/crawling-without-hexes-pointcrawl.html][here too]]
** Thinking About Urbancrawls
nothing i want to take notes on here, i'm probably not going to be running a
city-bound campaign any time soon
** Game Structure: Sector Crawl
[[https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/45878/roleplaying-games/game-structure-sector-crawl][article]]

some good stuff in here if the players actually want to start exploring the ship
thoroughly, but otherwise not useful yet

also potentially an idea in designing a megadungeon as a sector crawl
** Game Structure: The Festival
[[https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/45645/roleplaying-games/game-structure-the-festival][article]]

doesn't seem to be much here that would be useful -- the "festival" he's talking
about is more "burning man" than "knightly tournament"

feels like something to design a short campaign around, not something i'd work
up for section of a campaign
** Game Structure: Party Planning
[[https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/37995/roleplaying-games/game-structure-party-planning][article]]

big social events are great set pieces; hotbeds of intruige, innocent bystanders
raise the stakes if a fight breaks out, if a murder happens there's plenty of
suspects, if the pcs are trying to pull of a heist the bystanders add a
wonderful complication

also a good way to show that the pcs have changed their sphere of influence;
powerful and important people may want to make the acquaintance
*** location
where is this event taking place?

avoid making the location too small or too simple. need multiple zones of
activity so social groups can form and break apart. similarly, the pcs need to
have a natural barrier preventing them from interacting with every single npc at
the event at the same time

don't needs lots and lots of rooms; for example: a nightclub. it's got a dance
floor, the bar area, and a vip area -- you can probably see everybody from any
of those spots, but you can't interact with someone in the vip area when you're
at the bar.

this doesn't mean the area can't be a wholistic environment, either. the high
school dance from _Back to the Future_ has a dance floor, area around the punch
bowl, a backstage area, and a parking lot; not to mention the rest of the
school. private ( or theoretically private ) are a good idea -- not only do the
pcs get a place to gather and discuss things, but npcs can slip in or out of the
private areas to invoke intruige ("why did they leave just before the first dance?")
*** guest list
need a guest list of 10-20 people. fewer than 10 and it's not a party it's a
small gathering. more than 20 and i won't be able to manage things. aim for 15
folks.

first thing is a master list: names, titles, key fact.

then prep a sheet for each npc ( see [[*Universal NPC Roleplaying Template][Universal NPC Roleplaying Template]]
). biggest thing here is *key info*, the scenario-essential information that's
crucial for me to remember when using the NPC
*** main event sequence
an example sequence:
 - Announcing Guests of Special Honor
 - Iron Mage Appears
 - Aoska Arrives
 - Urlenius Arrives
 - Lord Dallimothan Arrives
 - Lady Rill Joins the Party
 - Arguing About the Balacazars
 - Debate of the Twelve Commanders
 - Sheva and Jevicca Seek Out the PCs
 - A Poetry Reading

these could be a linear sequence, a grab bag, or both.

pcs can also initiate alternative "major events", or they may end up derailing
or transforming the events that were originally planned. the main event sequence
is a tool -- not fate.

the sequence is also not the "story of the party". it's the core around which
the /experience/ of the party crystalizes.

*** topics of conversation
these could be momentous recent events, or just insignificant local happenings
(who won the latest kickball match?).

usually a good idea to mix "irrelevant" topics with the "important" ones, as
camouflage

some of the topics could/should be referenced in the *Key Info* section of NPCs on
the guest list

*** running the party
- what's happening right when the party arrives. what will attract their
  attention, who will they see? is there a major announcment? this will
  generally be the first event in the sequence. serves as initial hook and gives
  the players enough context to begin taking action
- after that, it's basically playing around with the toys i've created (npcs,
  topics of conversation, event sequence) -- which npcs are talking to each
  other? who might join a conversation with the pcs? what are folks talking
  about?
- encourage the pcs to split up. cutting back and forth between conversations is
  extremely effective in large social events. use [[https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/33791/roleplaying-games/the-art-of-pacing-part-5-advanced-techniques][crossovers]] between various
  interactions (ie, if one pc gets into a huge shouting match, other pcs should
  hear it or hear folks talking about it)
- keep social groups circulating.
- don't use up everything an npc has to offer in a single interaction
- pay attention to which npcs "click" with the pcs (positive or negative)
- if things start to lag, cut to another group of pcs or trigger the next event
  in the sequence
- don't hog the driver's seat; allow pcs to observe things they can /choose/ to
  react to. eg: instead of each NPC coming /to the player/, have npcs walk past or
  the pcs could overhear a conversation -- let the pc choose whether and how to engage
- make a point of asking them what they want to do -- and if they don't have an
  answer, next event in the sequence!

ultimately this works because i don't have to prep a bunch of specific interactions  

*** quick 'n dirty
just coppied whole hog from the site:

>If this social event is growing organically out of game play, then you’ve

** Universal NPC Roleplaying Template
the template:

- name
- appearance -- short and sweet, 1-2 sentences, 3 at max. most interesting and
  unique features
- quote -- single sentence, should help me get in the mindset/voice of the npc
- roleplaying -- a few brief bullet points. should have one simple, physical
  action to perform while playing the npc. *avoid repetition* by having each point
  describe a completely distinct classification of thing: values, physical
  mannerism, way of speaking, personality, etc.
- background -- a short narrative that covers essential context and interesting
  anecdotes. something that will influence how they make decisions, or something
  they'll use as context to explain stuff. use *bold* text to call out important
  features.
- key info -- essential interaction or info pcs should get from this npc. can
  have multiple key info sections, one for each "type" of info (ie, an npc in a
  mystery game at a party might have "clues" and "topics of conversation" as key
  info sections ).
- stat block -- comes last, least important

[[https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/37916/roleplaying-games/universal-npc-roleplaying-template][some examples]] are at the bottom of the page, use for reference if needed  
[[https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/46250/roleplaying-games/advanced-npc-templates][some expanded info]] on the advanced npc template page that could be handy

** Jaquaying the Dungeon
Series on how to make non-linear dungeons
*** Part 2 - Basic Techniques
Meant to offer complex geographic relationships (so players can have meaningful
choices), and to confuse the mapping/general understanding of the complex. Not
to create a maze, but so that the "hand of the author" and underlying structure
are obfuscated -- ie, players can't easily guess the way through the dungeon.

*Multiple Entrances*
Immediate strategic choice. Hidden entrances reward exploration in and out of
the dungeon.

*Loops*
Branching paths are functionally linear, they're just linear paths that may not
lead to the "goal". Loops provide meaningful strategic and tactical choices,
make exploration meaningful, and allow PCs to find alternative routes
around/through potential threats.

*Multiple Level Connections*
Create loops between levels of the dungeon to prevent the complexity of a
specific level from collapsing into a chokepoint.

*Discontinuous Level Connections*
Have connections between levels that aren't "neighbours". An elevator that goes
from level 1 to level 4. A tunnel on level 3 that takes you to a hidden entrance
half a mile away from the dungeon. Etc, etc.

*Secret & Unusual Paths*
"One thing to note is that not every secret path needs to take the conventional
form of a camouflaged doorway: Tunnels that have suffered cave-ins. Traps that
drop you to lower levels. Archaic teleportation systems that must be
decoded. Rope bridges that cross over caverns that can also be explored from
below. A submerged bypass connecting two seemingly unrelated lakes."

*Sub-Levels*
Smaller, or difficult to reach, or both -- these are areas of the dungeon/ruin
where players are no longer on the previous "level", but it's not a whole floor.

*Divided Levels*
Levels in which one section is inaccessible from elsewhere on the same level.
A good example is a level that has two staircases leading down to the level
below; but there is no path connecting those two staircases on that lower
level (there could be an incredibly well hidden or difficult to traverse path,
though, but shouldn't be common)

*Nested Dungeons*
Having two separate and distinct dungeons that have been linked through various
means (creature dug a tunnel, teleports,
etc). [[https://www.thealexandrian.net/creations/misc/jaquay-dungeon/kots-jaquay5.jpg][image example]].

*Minor Elevation Shifts*
Have parts of a single level be different elevation -- staircases that don't
lead down to the next floor, etc.

This isn't just about confusing the player's mapping -- it's disrupting their
ability to intuit the organization of my maps by analyzing the reality of the
game world.

*Midpoint Entry*
Instead of just entering on level 1 and going down (to level 2, then 3, etc),
have them enter and have the choice of going up /or/ down -- from level 1 they can
get to +2 or -2, etc.

*Non-Euclidian Geometry*
Think places inspired by MC Escher, etc. Waterfalls that are their own source, a
group of rooms where you can travel ever downwards but still be on the same
level, etc.

[[https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/4974/roleplaying-games/halls-of-the-mad-mage][An example dungeon here]]

*Extradimensional Spaces*
A portion of the dungeon/ruin may extend into an extradimensional space.
*** Part 3 - Philosophy
Don't think of these techniques as ways to make chaotic, "funhouse dungeon"
designs that don't make logical sense.

*Beware Sprawl*
Too many loops, connections, and whatnot turn meaningful choices into
meaningless ones.

*Structure In The Dungeon*
Some useful barometers:

/Difficult vs Easy/ - there should be areas that are easy to reach, and some that
are difficult to reach. This assessment is to try and determine of the choice of
path through the dungeon is irrelevant or not. The dungeon should _benefit_ from
being interconnected -- but if it's trivially easy to get from one spot to
another then navigation is meaningless.

/Far vs Near/ - There should be places that _feel_ far away from the
entrance(s). Note: "near" and/or "easy to reach" aren't problems to be
eliminated, the goal is an effective balance of difficult, easy, far, near.

*Landmarks*
Players need distinct, memorable landmarks in order to orient themselves. If the
dungeon has lots of unique, interesting features then this problem will take
care of itself.

Players may provide their own ("hey, it's that thing we killed last week").

Landmarks /can/ be used to mess with players: corpses disappear, runes missing,
something that seemed unique turns out to not be.

If feeling particularly crafty, try to hide reliable navigation information in
seemingly unreliable landmarks.
*** Part 4 - Example
Keep on Shadowfell remix, not something to take notes on
([[https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/13123/roleplaying-games/jaquaying-the-dungeon-part-4-jaquaying-the-keep-on-the-shadowfell][but here's the article if I want to read it again later]])
** Revelations
"/Normal weapons can’t kill the zombies. MicroMan doesn’t trust Captain Fury. The
lake monster is really Old Man Wiggins in a rubber mask./

These are Revelations. They are things you want the players to find out so that
they can make good choices or just understand what is going on in the
game. Revelations advance the plot and make the game dramatically
interesting. If the players don’t find them out (or don’t find them out at the
right time) they can mess up your game."

- understanding revelations requires me to see things through the eyes of my
  players; what are they going to think, is it a surprise, is it consistent,
  etc.

*Write Your Revelations*
- shows how the game "should" flow -- things get hectic once we actually start
  playing
- doesn't have to be detailed, probably better for each revelation to be a
  single, simple sentence
- ie, "the Duke is now left-handed" -- all the other details of
  who|what|where|why are either part of the adventure, not important, or the
  details will be keyed from memory via the sentence
- revelations aren't canned moments, doesn't matter precisely how the fact will
  be revealed
- it's fine to have ideas, plans, or expectations -- but don't count on those
  plans working out
- a bare-bones list of revelations lets me go with the flow but remember
  critical details

*Notes*
- players may figure out more than i expect, sooner than i expect; revelations
  are really the minimum the players should know at any point so the game still works
- revelations can be optional -- doesn't matter if the PCs notice the Duke is
  left-handed if they already figured out he's an imposter
- revelations are also moments /in play/ -- players may already know the Duke has
  been replaced, but until they talk about it in-character i still need the
  revelation so they can roleplay their reactions and whatnot
