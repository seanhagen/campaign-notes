* Entry 123 - The Ship & Crystals
Found someone new in the Ship today. An ancient intelligence that used to help
run the ship. A much bigger find than I expected, given our recent luck. She
says her name is Neta, although apparently some of her memories are missing so
she's not one hundred percent sure about that.

So odd to meet a disembodied intelligence. So unlike the machine intelligences
I'm used to running into in ruins and strange places. With them, it's a toss-up
whether you've met a friend or potential trade partner, or one that's been
mistreated or has gone insane and just wants to kill you. Although I have to
admit, "meatbag" is a pretty good epithet for us humans.

Neta showed me to a "nexus room", identified by this symbol:

She shows me the crystals, and told me that these contained her memories and
specialized functions. Apparently many have been lost to time or scavengers, but
there are enough still remaining that if they're returned to her she'll have
much better control over the ship, including the launch bay for an airship.

I went to check out this airship, because such a vehicle could make our lives
much easier. It's protected by a field of energy, some kind of stasis field or
time lock. There's a plinth in front of the energy field that takes the
crystals. I fiddled with the plinth a bit, trying to bypass the need for the
crystals, but all I managed to do was reconnect the emitter that allowed Neta to
show up in this chamber.

She said that the plinth needs a specific set of crystals in order for her to be
able to turn off the field. Apparently trying to bypass the crystals could have
caused me to have a real bad day. Based on what Neta's told me, four of the
six crystals are in crashed parts of the ship that should all be fairly close
to Ararholm.

Based on what she told me, the other two are a bit further away. One is probably
in either the dead forest to the south, or in the impassible forest to the
south-east. I really hope it's in the dead forest, because the impassible forest
got its name for a reason. (scribbled note in margin: maybe not so impenetrable,
seems like there may be some time-dependent paths that open up)

The other is to the west. Preferably it's in the desert mesas to the south-west,
not much is out there beyond creatures that are too focused on finding water to
really be of much concern. Otherwise it's in the red forest (margin note: Pamki,
don't go in the red forest without hearing protection) or the fungal forest. It
had better not be in the fungal forest, still haven't figured out a way to
protect folks from the spores. Thankfully they're not deadly, they just make
keeping people together and safe much harder.

Neta said that a few parts of the ship crashed down to the north of the river;
somewhere in the forests to the north-west, in the mountains to the north, and
the swamps to the north-east. The pieces better not be across the river, because
if they are they might as well be on the moon. The river itself is dangerous --
haven't found a safe crossing point in the two years I've been looking. There
are some potential spots to cross to the east, or potentially a way through the
swamps. But the swamps are far too dangerous to try and pathfind through, and
we've got better uses for wood right now than trying to build a bridge.

Although.

There may be a spot I can use the line caster to get across the river to the
north-west, just north of the fungal forest. I'll save that option for later,
if I can't find the other crystals in this area of Maka-Tho. I can't end up
stuck on the other side of the river, not when Tashi is pregnant.

This whole line of inquiry may have to be put on hold for a while. I can't go
too far, not until the baby is born. Maybe not even after that. It takes a while
for word to get to Calda from here, but word will reach the rest of the world
that Tashi and I are having a child. I don't know how long before word reaches
him, but I need to make sure they're both ready and safe. I stole his greatest
treasure, and while I don't put much stock in grand threats I can't risk
anything happening to either of them.

I have to make sure they and Ararholm are ready.
