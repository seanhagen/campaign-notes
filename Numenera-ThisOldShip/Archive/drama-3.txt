Maka-Tho is an uncharted land. It lay beneath the pink mists for longer than
anybody knows. The mist itself was incredibly dangerous. As far as everyone
knows, it will defeat any armor and find a way around whatever protective
numenera you had.

If that's what formed the wall of this region, some wonder, what might it have
been keeping in? Some Aeon Priests theorized that the mist wasn't solid, that
the interior was as livable as the lands of Calda or Sudboia. What creatures may
have lived beneath a sky of pink mist?

On the other hand, if the Maka-Tho mists did completely blanket the entire
region; might there have been some creatures who lived within the mist? Animals
or abhumans who adapted to the mist somehow, or were created to live within it?

What of the mist itself? Nobody knows why it disappeared. Will it come back? Is
there a cypher somewhere, dropped by an explorer who explored on foot or flew
overhead, that caused the mist to disappear? Was there some device that
generated the mist? If there is, can it be turned back on? Can the properties of
the mist be controlled? Can it be made safe for one group of people while being
deadly to another? Can it be placed differently, or used as a weapon?

There are mysteries aplenty in Maka-Tho, and the mist and what it covered is but
one group of them.
