† Protomatter can’t be salvaged from cyphers, artifacts, automatons or other
objects, scrap, or ruins of the numenera that are smaller than 40 feet (12 m) on
a side because 1 unit of protomatter is almost that massive (unless some sort of
extradimensional space to house the protomatter unit is involved). If this
result occurs in relation to a source that’s too small, thaum dust is salvaged
instead.

*** Required Resources
Here's the info on what is required for building artifacts and
cyphers. Installations & automatons list the required iotum & units of parts in
each plan, so they're not listed here.
**** Artifacts
Specifications*: When a crafter has a plan for a specific artifact, they can try
to craft it at that artifact’s minimum crafting level or higher. Use this
template to determine the iotum requirements based on the level of the completed
artifact. The GM may decide that additional iotum is required, depending on the
effect produced.

*Depletion*: 1 in 1d20 or varies

*Parts*: 10 × the level of the completed artifact

**** Cyphers
*Specifications*: This plan is a template. When a crafter has a plan for a
specific cypher, they can try to craft it at that cypher’s minimum crafting
level or higher. Use this template to determine the iotum requirements based on
the level of the completed cypher. The GM may decide that additional iotum is
required, depending on the effect produced.

*Depletion*: Cypher

*Parts*: 3 × the level of the completed cypher

** Full Plans
These are the things Mex has a complete set of plans for, all she needs is
parts. Artifacts & cyphers list the level that Mex can build that item at
without any issues. She can build them at a higher level, but risks failing in
the task and using up the materials without producing anything.

** Partial Plans
Mex has partial plans for these numenera & structures. More plans seeds must be
found for Mex to create a full plan she can use to build from. She doesn't know
what level or how long it'll take, she needs the full plan to figure that out.

** Known Numenera

*** Artifacts
**** Automated Bath
*Level*: 1d6

*Form*: A small metal-and-synth hovering sphere that has metallic arms, tubes, and
cleaning tools

*Effect*: This automaton cleans a nearby target on command if the target doesn’t
resist. If allowed to finish, over the course of about a minute, the target is
cleaned of all dirt and grime, their teeth are cleaned, their hair is washed and
brushed, and their nails are trimmed. This also cleans the target’s clothing.

*Depletion*: 1 in 1d100
**** Salvage Pack
*Level*: 1d6 + 1

*Form*: Synth pack with attached devices

*Effect*: This pack’s mouth can be loosened to open as wide as 6 feet (2 m) in
diameter. It is larger on the inside than on the outside thanks to
transdimensional outpocketing, and it can contain up to 5 tons (4.5 t) worth of
material.

*Depletion*: 1 in 1d100 (check each time something is added to the pack; on
depletion, all objects are expelled from the pack)
**** Box of Embers
*Level*: 1d6

*Form*: Very small synth panel or patch affixed to a melee weapon or other tool

*Effect*: Once attached, this nodule causes the hilt of the weapon or tool to glow
with a pulsing reddish-black light. The patch has no effect on the item during
combat, but three small buttons on the side allow the user to control the other
effects: light (a red glow that allows the user to see at night as if it were
daylight), heat (enough to melt ice or keep one person warm even in freezing
temperatures), and firestarting (while in this mode, blowing on the hilt will
release enough embers from the weapon to start a fire).

*Depletion*: —
*** Cyphers
**** Explosive Implant
Once this substance enters the bloodstream, it travels to the brain and
reorganizes into an explosive that detonates when activated via a detonator
(must be within long range), inflicting 10 points of damage (ignoring Armor)
**** Defoliant
One chlorophyl-based plant of a level lower than the cypher is instantly killed
**** Rejuvinator
One Pool of the user's choice is restored by a number of points equal to the
cypher's level.
**** Poison (Pacification)
The victim lays down for one minute with eyes closed when told to do so (once).
*** Installations
**** Alarm Tower
*Minimum Crafting Level*: 5   *Kind*: Installation

*Iotum*: Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (10 units); synthsteel (8 units); apt
clay (3 units); mimetic gel (2 units); amber crystal (5 units); quantium (2
units); midnight stone (2 units)

*Parts*: 48 units

*Specifications*: This plan produces a 3-foot (1 m) diameter crystal sphere fixed
atop a metallic mast that reaches 50 feet (15 m) into the air.  It also produces
a linked, handheld device with a control surface. The alarm tower monitors along
a circumference up to a very long distance away from the tower in all
directions. The tower notifies the holder of the handheld device if it detects
unusual motion, behavior associated with attempts at stealth, or attempts at
crossing the circumference that haven’t been previously cleared by the builder
(for example, normal traffic on a road or through a gate would probably be
cleared by the builder). The alarm tower could be set to scan for different
criteria, such as the appearance of a certain kind of creature or even a
specific individual.  Such a device modifies a community’s rank by +1 for tasks
related to perception.

*Depletion*: 1 in 1d20 (check per year of use)
**** Automender
*Minimum Crafting Level*: 3    *Kind*: Installation

*Iotum*: Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (5 units); synthsteel (2 units); apt
clay (3 units); mimetic gel (2 units); quantium (2 units)

*Parts*: 29 units

*Specifications*: This plan produces a fixed solid no less than 3 feet (1 m) on a
side with a cavity large enough for a human to stick their arm or leg
into. Someone who does so regains 3 points to a Pool of their choice but no more
than once in any ten-hour period.

*Depletion*: 1 in 1d20 (check after each day the automender is used)
**** Cooling Obelisk
*Minimum Crafting Level*: 1   *Kind*: Installation

*Iotum*: Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (10 units); synthsteel (1 unit)

*Parts*: 11 units

*Specifications*: This plan produces a 3-foot (1 m) long synth-and-metal obelisk
that cools the air around it. If placed within an area protected from the wind,
the elements, direct vacuum, or other environmental effects (such as in a small
hut, in a tent, under the eaves of a lean-to, and so on), the cooling obelisk
can cool a single area (or several contiguous, bounded areas) up to a short
distance in diameter at a temperature that is comfortably cool for humans, even
amidst desert-like conditions.

*Depletion*: 1 in d20 (check per month of use)

**** Force Wall
*Minimum Crafting Level*: 6   *Kind*: Installation

*Iotum*: Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (17 units); synthsteel (5 units);
mimetic gel (4 units); pliable metal (10 units); quantium (4 units); kaon dot (5
units)

*Parts*: 64 units

*Specifications*: This plan produces a fixed solid no less than 5 feet (1.5 m) on
a side. When activated, it creates an immobile plane of solid force up to 25
feet (8 m) tall, 50 feet (15 m) long, and 3 feet (1 m) thick within very long
range. The wall conforms to the space available. The wall can be toggled on and
off directly or through a remote handheld device. The force wall adds +2 Armor
to a community’s stats if the wall controls a checkpoint.

*Depletion*: 1 in 1d20 (check each year of use)
**** Keepsafe Bin
*Minimum Crafting Level*: 2  *Kind*: Installation

*Iotum*: Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (13 units); synthsteel (3 units); thaum dust (1 unit)

*Parts*: 15 units

*Specifications*: This plan produces a fixed solid no less than 4 feet (1 m) on a
side with an interior cavity almost as large that can be closed. When closed, no
time passes within the cavity for a period of up to a week outside. At the end
of the week, the cavity hatch opens and must be reset.

*Depletion*: 1 in 1d20 (check after each week of use)
**** Luminous Dynamo
*Minimum Crafting Level*: 1   *Kind*: Installation

*Iotum*: Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (9 units); quantium (1 unit)

*Parts*: 12 units

*Specifications*: This plan produces a cube-like device about 3 feet (1 m) on a
side and up to four somewhat fragile crystalline spheres. As long as the spheres
are within long range of the cube, touching them triggers bright light in an
immediate range (and dim light within short range) for up to ten hours or until
they are touched again to turn the light off.

*Depletion*: 1 in 1d100 (check per week of use)
**** Vermin Ward
*Minimum Crafting Level*: 2  *Kind*: Installation

*Iotum*: Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (14 units); synthsteel (5 units); apt
clay (2 units)

*Parts*: 22 units

*Specifications*: This plan produces a fixed solid no less than 3 feet (1 m) on a
side with several metallic antennas protruding at odd angles. The device
operates continually once activated, warding an area at least a short distance
across from mundane insects and vermin via a psychic exclusion field.

*Depletion*: 1 in 1d20 (check each month of use)

*** Automatons
**** Assistant
*Minimum Crafting Level*: 5
*Kind*: Automaton
*Iotum*: io (1d6 units); responsive synth (14 units); apt clay (8 units); pliable
metal (7 units); smart tissue (3 units); monopole (1 unit); psiranium (2 units)

*Parts*: 52 units

*Specifications*:
This plan produces an automaton that stands about 5 feet (1.5 m) tall with a
body plan that only approximately resembles a human. The automaton moves on a
single rolling sphere but has two mechanical arms. It is a level 5 creature with
a limited repertoire of capabilities. Those capabilities are hard-coded into the
assistant when it is first constructed, allowing it to provide an asset on up to
five non-combat tasks for a PC or other creature that makes use of the assistant
automaton. The assistant is suited to staying in one location, but it can travel
if asked to do so. However, each full day of travel requires an additional
depletion roll.

*Modification*: To modify the assistant to have additional capabilities, add 2
units of responsive synth for each additional capability desired.

*Depletion*: 1 in 1d20 (check per month of use)
**** Extractor
*Minimum Crafting Level*: 4   *Kind*: Automaton

*Iotum*: Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (16 units); apt clay (4 units); pliable
metal (4 units); quantium (3 units) Parts: 44 units

*Specifications*: This plan produces a discshaped automaton about 4 feet (1 m) in
diameter that moves up to a short distance each round on a bed of forced
air. When released in an area where iotum salvage can be potentially found, the
automaton harvests what it can find and extract on its own, providing one
additional iotum (up to level 6) per hour that the extractor works in an area
that still has salvage. Once it has acquired 5 units of iotum, it returns to a
predetermined location and waits to be unpacked. It can return earlier if set to
do so.

*Modifications*: To double the iotum the extractor can gather and increase the
level of iotum it can gather by 1, a crafter can treat the plan as 1 level
higher and add 3 units of smart tissue and 1 unit of psiranium.

*Depletion*: 1 in 1d20 (check per week of use)
**** Garden Mech
*Minimum Crafting Level*: 2  *Kind*: Automaton

*Iotum*: Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (9 units); apt clay (2 units); pliable
metal (4 units)

*Parts*: 20 units

*Specifications*: This plan produces a discshaped limited automaton about 1 foot
(30 cm) in diameter. The mech moves on a dozen metallic legs. When released in
an area where tended plants are already growing, whether decorative or food
crops, the automaton sets to work tending to their needs within an area up to a
short range across. It removes pests by hand, aerates the soil, and performs
other related tasks, providing an asset to any task attempted by characters to
successfully grow plants within that area.

*Depletion*: 1 in 1d20 (check per growing season)
