* Characters
** npc with faith
This quote from the Dune appendix speaks to me: 
"Religion must remain an outlet for people who say to themselves, “I am not the
kind of person I want to be.” It must never sink into an assemblage of the
self-satisfied."

Need a deeply religious and spiritual NPC who embodies this idea.
** knight
Someone with an amulet like Merlin's Amulet from Trollhunter.


* Places
** giant crystal
- like the heartstone in trollhunter, just a massive crystal the size of the
  empire state building
* Monsters
* Misc
** myths, legends, rumors
- the poem/prophecy/thing from TrollHunters P1:E15 ( triumbric stones )
- the nowhere king song/poem from centaurworld
