seamstress/madam: Jun Shitoshi

ruling:
 - going up a level on the damage track is a level 4/6 difficulty task depending
   on if the character is impaired or debilitated
 - healing points in a pool is an intellect task with the difficulty equal to
   how many points they're trying to heal

other bits:    
 - maps will be symbolic on world anvil instead of using hex paper, players won't
   be doing cartography of the area
 - determine what the bandits had on them that the party takes
 - map out some more ruins on the overworld -- maybe find something to do the
   mapping digitally, so it's easier to run off the laptop
 - trade and stuff: stores that sell common goods will take shins, merchants that
   sell rarer stuff will barter ( or take a LOT of shins, like more than the
   item is really worth ) 

* Session 2
2021-11-07

Party is on their way back to Ararholm with their captives.

 - takes them about 35 minutes to get back to town
 - arrive back in town in late afternoon
 - the sheriff embarasses zeno ( mentions their dinner date with mex )
 - the group decides to wait until they've got information from the captives
 - decide to go back to the ruin either at night, or pre-dawn
 - find the green cloaks, leave the thief (barnabus) in the chamber where they
   were staying, bring the other two along
 - didn't antagonize the colchin in the interstitiatl chamber, are allowed to
   pass without issue
 - using a mind spike, klep is able to effortlessly disable a trap set to
   prevent folks from getting closer to where the bandits were hiding out
 - the party is creeped out by the ice sculpture room
 - make a plan of attack for ghoka's men
 - ureos creates an illusion that the hallway to the chamber where the gang is
   in, so that it looks empty
 - fox throws a needleburst cypher, that ureos sets off with his voice. this
   kills several bandits
 - zeno shoots a frangible shell at the other bandits, killing three
 - belel and klep are unable to damage the big bandit
 - the big bandit rushes the hallway, and after passing through the doorway
   recovers quickly enough to attack klep, doing 10 points of damage and
   knocking him down one step on the damage track
 - belel creates a zone of dark tentacles, hindering the bandit leader and his subordinates
 - in the swirling melee, klep takes a few more hits, knocking him further down
   the damage track
 - fox disarms the bandit leader, stealing his sword right out of his hand
 - zeno pushes klep out of the way, and stands between the bandit leader and klep
 - session ends...

stuff to do before next session:
 - figure out the properties of Ukrurg's sword for Fox
 - stat up the two green cloaks a bit more
 - get list of personality traits, quirks, and other things for each of the PCs
   to use as inspiration for GM Intrusions while playing ( ie, oh, Fox is doing
   <this kind of thing>, use a GM intrusion that <does something like this> )
 - build gm intrusions into the rest of the ruins
 - add another cypher or two to the gear that Ukrurg is carrying
 - set up emacs so that I can mark chambers/etc in ruins as UNEXPLORED or EXPLORED
 - see about making my own table thing (copy from org-d20) for handling combat
 - see what else i can do to better run games from within emacs
 - figure out best way to remind myself that players are supposed to roll to
   determine what a cypher or artefact is
 - how many times can they try to identify a numenera per hour/day/etc

stuff to remember for next session:
 - don't need pencils or paper, doing everything in emacs works pretty well
