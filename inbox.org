What I do, I do for the people of the Sable Hegemony!

*Roleplaying*
| Thing | Physical Action |
|-------+-----------------|
| physical mannerism | slow, deliberate movements; tends to have his arms crossed |
| mode of speech | tends to use fables and myths when explaining things |
| personality | a bright and cheerful soul that is hidden behind a fortress wall |

  a few brief bullet points. should have one simple, physical action to perform
  while playing the npc. *avoid repetition* by having each point describe a
  completely distinct classification of thing: values, physical mannerism, way
  of speaking, personality, etc.

** Key Info
  essential interaction or info pcs should get from this npc. can have multiple
  key info sections, one for each 'type' of info (ie, an npc in a mystery game
  at a party might have 'clues' and 'topics of conversation' as key info
  sections ).

** Appearance
 Big nose, deep voice, kind of built like Maui from Moana.

** Background
  a short narrative that covers essential context and interesting
  anecdotes. something that will influence how they make decisions, or something
  they'll use as context to explain stuff. use *bold* text to call out important
  features.

|--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| physical mannerism | always brushing her clothes for dust, even though she can't get dust on her     |
| mode of speech     | very prim and proper                                                            |
| personality        | straightforward but naive                                                       |
| physical mannerism | is always talking to herself about ship systems ( flow rates, luminosity, etc ) |

** Key Info
 - can control some aspects of the ship
 - large portions of her memory are locked away
 - the crystals they placed in the pedestal unlocked some of her memories (like
   how to make a hologram)

** Appearance
 A hologram of solid light, Felwinter appears as an adult human woman (age
 unknown). Surrounded by fragments of code that float through the air. Dressed
 in what appears to be noble garb from a past age.

** Background
Went through rampancy and was responsible for the accident that caused the ship
to end up where it is now. Knows she should feel something about that, but
because the memory cores containing those memories went offline ages ago she
can't remember. Not remembering parts of her own history causes her to feel
grief and anxiety; partially because she may have forgotten something important
about the ship, but also because she feels she can't atone until she remembers
what she did. She is also scared that gaining access to the memory cores on the
ship will change who she is -- her greatest fear is becoming a monster.

** Stat Block
Doesn't have much she can do to affect the physical world beyond using
automatons.

*** Ureos

*** Ureos
[11:57 AM] Nethew: I think I thought of a cool moment that Ureos could have at
some point. I'll have to think of some lore behind it, but I love the idea that
his people have a forbidden "dance of death" that basically channels the latest
energy/ether in your surroundings through you to hyper-empower yourself and your
allies, but at a great physical cost. Would be cool to have a moment where we're
just up against crazy odds and he has to bust this out as a last resort.

Mechanically I'm thinking it's something where I'd have to burn an intrusion,
and have a heavy effort cost that increases per turn, so it'd be super dangerous
and potentially lethal. Probably have some permanent lasting effect on Ureos too
if he survives.

Had this idea while farming a FFXIV instance last night. The music for it was
super hype and I felt like it'd fit that kind of moment really well

[12:05 PM] Nethew: Actually, I just thought of a great lasting effect it could
have. It could change his descriptor entirely so he isn't graceful any
more. Maybe to something like Clever, Cheerful or Nurturing.

[12:24 PM] Nethew: Also, I was talking about character conflicts with Don and
Will and they were asking what would happen if Ureos's family was in trouble
back in the Steadfast and I was like, "He'd probably go back, no
question". Which made me wonder, is the portal between Ararholm and the
Steadfast still open?

Ureos' family is alive and well, but if family drama comes up later on in the
campaign when the world is at stake it might make for some good Family vs. Found
Family stuff.

[2:11 PM] Hagen: portal is still open but it's like a 2-month trek just to get
to the portal ( plus more walking on the other side ) -- although, a ship would
drastically reduce how much time it takes ðŸ˜„

[2:11 PM] Nethew: Ooooo

[2:11 PM] Nethew: Good to know!

[4:36 PM] Nethew: Heard this today as well and immediately thought that it would
fit so well if we ever had to fight a big bad from the Sable Hedgemony

*** Fox
Okay, I think the song Iâ€™m going to go with is Party Poison by My Chemical Romance.

https://youtu.be/iw_-pACvP-A

My Chemical Romance - Topic
Party Poison

[7:26 AM] Jessy (DMs of Vancouver): Iâ€™m thinking kind of a scene where Fox
initially has to face a big threat (maybe a large group of bandits or some sort
of swarm/mob) alone and kind of one by one NPCs and party members enter the
fray. Kind of culminating in a big fight in town with everyone getting involved.
