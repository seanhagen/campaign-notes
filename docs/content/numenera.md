# Numenera


<a id="orgb49daae"></a>

## Cyphers


<a id="orgd73f4a1"></a>

### Explosive Implant

Once this substance enters the bloodstream, it travels to the brain and reorganizes into an explosive that detonates when activated via a detonator (must be within long range), inflicting 10 points of damage (ignoring Armor)


<a id="org34168dc"></a>

### Defoliant

One chlorophyl-based plant of a level lower than the cypher is instantly killed


<a id="org5f0cd4c"></a>

### Rejuvinator

One Pool of the user's choice is restored by a number of points equal to the cypher's level.


<a id="orgb027aa8"></a>

### Poison (Pacification)

The victim lays down for one minute with eyes closed when told to do so (once).


<a id="org34019be"></a>

## Artifacts


<a id="org355fec2"></a>

### Automated Bath

**Level**: 1d6

**Form**: A small metal-and-synth hovering sphere that has metallic arms, tubes, and cleaning tools

**Effect**: This automaton cleans a nearby target on command if the target doesn’t resist. If allowed to finish, over the course of about a minute, the target is cleaned of all dirt and grime, their teeth are cleaned, their hair is washed and brushed, and their nails are trimmed. This also cleans the target’s clothing.

**Depletion**: 1 in 1d100


<a id="org1bcd23c"></a>

### Box of Embers

**Level**: 1d6

**Form**: Very small synth panel or patch affixed to a melee weapon or other tool

**Effect**: Once attached, this nodule causes the hilt of the weapon or tool to glow with a pulsing reddish-black light. The patch has no effect on the item during combat, but three small buttons on the side allow the user to control the other effects: light (a red glow that allows the user to see at night as if it were daylight), heat (enough to melt ice or keep one person warm even in freezing temperatures), and firestarting (while in this mode, blowing on the hilt will release enough embers from the weapon to start a fire).

**Depletion**: —

## Installations


<a id="orgdac0fe8"></a>

### Alarm Tower

**Minimum Crafting Level**: 5 **Kind**: Installation

**Iotum**: Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (10 units); synthsteel (8 units); apt clay (3 units); mimetic gel (2 units); amber crystal (5 units); quantium (2 units); midnight stone (2 units)

**Parts**: 48 units

**Specifications**: This plan produces a 3-foot (1 m) diameter crystal sphere fixed atop a metallic mast that reaches 50 feet (15 m) into the air. It also produces a linked, handheld device with a control surface. The alarm tower monitors along a circumference up to a very long distance away from the tower in all directions. The tower notifies the holder of the handheld device if it detects unusual motion, behavior associated with attempts at stealth, or attempts at crossing the circumference that haven’t been previously cleared by the builder (for example, normal traffic on a road or through a gate would probably be cleared by the builder). The alarm tower could be set to scan for different criteria, such as the appearance of a certain kind of creature or even a specific individual. Such a device modifies a community’s rank by +1 for tasks related to perception.

**Depletion**: 1 in 1d20 (check per year of use)


<a id="org921c554"></a>

### Automender

**Minimum Crafting Level**: 3 **Kind**: Installation

**Iotum**: Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (5 units); synthsteel (2 units); apt clay (3 units); mimetic gel (2 units); quantium (2 units)

**Parts**: 29 units

**Specifications**: This plan produces a fixed solid no less than 3 feet (1 m) on a side with a cavity large enough for a human to stick their arm or leg into. Someone who does so regains 3 points to a Pool of their choice but no more than once in any ten-hour period.

**Depletion**: 1 in 1d20 (check after each day the automender is used)


<a id="org767add0"></a>

### Cooling Obelisk

**Minimum Crafting Level**: 1 **Kind**: Installation

**Iotum**: Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (10 units); synthsteel (1 unit)

**Parts**: 11 units

**Specifications**: This plan produces a 3-foot (1 m) long synth-and-metal obelisk that cools the air around it. If placed within an area protected from the wind, the elements, direct vacuum, or other environmental effects (such as in a small hut, in a tent, under the eaves of a lean-to, and so on), the cooling obelisk can cool a single area (or several contiguous, bounded areas) up to a short distance in diameter at a temperature that is comfortably cool for humans, even amidst desert-like conditions.

**Depletion**: 1 in d20 (check per month of use)


<a id="org9990e6b"></a>

### Force Wall

**Minimum Crafting Level**: 6 **Kind**: Installation

**Iotum**: Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (17 units); synthsteel (5 units); mimetic gel (4 units); pliable metal (10 units); quantium (4 units); kaon dot (5 units)

**Parts**: 64 units

**Specifications**: This plan produces a fixed solid no less than 5 feet (1.5 m) on a side. When activated, it creates an immobile plane of solid force up to 25 feet (8 m) tall, 50 feet (15 m) long, and 3 feet (1 m) thick within very long range. The wall conforms to the space available. The wall can be toggled on and off directly or through a remote handheld device. The force wall adds +2 Armor to a community’s stats if the wall controls a checkpoint.

**Depletion**: 1 in 1d20 (check each year of use)


<a id="org86939a5"></a>

### Keepsafe Bin

**Minimum Crafting Level**: 2 **Kind**: Installation

**Iotum**: Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (13 units); synthsteel (3 units); thaum dust (1 unit)

**Parts**: 15 units

**Specifications**: This plan produces a fixed solid no less than 4 feet (1 m) on a side with an interior cavity almost as large that can be closed. When closed, no time passes within the cavity for a period of up to a week outside. At the end of the week, the cavity hatch opens and must be reset.

**Depletion**: 1 in 1d20 (check after each week of use)


<a id="org07ed6e6"></a>

### Luminous Dynamo

**Minimum Crafting Level**: 1 **Kind**: Installation

**Iotum**: Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (9 units); quantium (1 unit)

**Parts**: 12 units

**Specifications**: This plan produces a cube-like device about 3 feet (1 m) on a side and up to four somewhat fragile crystalline spheres. As long as the spheres are within long range of the cube, touching them triggers bright light in an immediate range (and dim light within short range) for up to ten hours or until they are touched again to turn the light off.

**Depletion**: 1 in 1d100 (check per week of use)


<a id="org7e50eb7"></a>

### Vermin Ward

**Minimum Crafting Level**: 2 **Kind**: Installation

**Iotum**: Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (14 units); synthsteel (5 units); apt clay (2 units)

**Parts**: 22 units

**Specifications**: This plan produces a fixed solid no less than 3 feet (1 m) on a side with several metallic antennas protruding at odd angles. The device operates continually once activated, warding an area at least a short distance across from mundane insects and vermin via a psychic exclusion field.

**Depletion**: 1 in 1d20 (check each month of use)


<a id="orgd550096"></a>

## Vehicles


<a id="orgdc1053d"></a>

### Chainpod

**Minimum Crafting Level**: 4 **Kind**: Vehicle

**Iotum**: Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (8 units); pliable metal (1 unit); synthsteel (2 units); mimetic gel (1 unit); amber crystal (1 unit)

**Parts**: 43 units

**Specifications**: This plan produces a 6-foot (2 m) diameter spherical vehicle that holds one person. The chainpod’s entire outer surface is a kind of wheel, but the driver doesn’t spin along with the wheel. The driver can use the control surface to cause the vehicle to roll up to a long distance each round over smooth terrain or a well-maintained road, or up to a short distance per round over rough roads or wild terrain. On extended trips over smooth terrain, it can move up to 80 miles per hour (130 kph).

A chainpod can roll underwater at half speed or swim in any direction up to an immediate distance each round. Chainpods are watertight but do not provide breathable air, so a typical human using a chainpod underwater should surface every four hours to refresh the air supply.

After each five hours of use, a chainpod must rest in the sun for at least one hour before it becomes operational again.

Multiple chainpods can magnetically link to each other if they make physical contact (even when moving at full speed). Linked chainpods operate as one vehicle controlled by the lead driver, moving in a line like beads on a string. Only the lead chainpod consumes power, allowing the others to recharge while being towed. Any occupant can instantly unlink their chainpod from others in the chain (a chainpod unlinked from the lead pod becomes immediately active and drivable).

**Depletion**: 1–2 in 1d100 (check per day of use)


<a id="org5a43ec4"></a>

### Hover Frame

**Minimum Crafting Level**: 2 **Kind**: Vehicle

**Iotum**: Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (23 units); pliable metal (3 units); quantium (3 units)

**Parts**: 19 units

**Specifications**: This plan produces an open frame supported by silvery, ground-effect discs that negate and push against gravity, allowing it to pass over any terrain, including water, without slowing. However, the groundeffect force isn’t as efficient as direct contact, and a hover frame’s maximum speed is only an immediate distance each round. On extended trips, it can move up to 3 miles per hour (5 kph).The frame features a place for a driver to lash themselves plus an additional space where a passenger or cargo could be lashed underneath. After each ten hours of use, the hover frame must rest in the sun for at least one hour before it becomes operational again.

**Depletion**: 1 in 1d20 (check per week of use)


<a id="orgfb8b6b6"></a>

## Automatons


<a id="org06e9f7e"></a>

### Assistant

**Minimum Crafting Level**: 5 **Kind**: Automaton **Iotum**: io (1d6 units); responsive synth (14 units); apt clay (8 units); pliable metal (7 units); smart tissue (3 units); monopole (1 unit); psiranium (2 units)

**Parts**: 52 units

**Specifications**: This plan produces an automaton that stands about 5 feet (1.5 m) tall with a body plan that only approximately resembles a human. The automaton moves on a single rolling sphere but has two mechanical arms. It is a level 5 creature with a limited repertoire of capabilities. Those capabilities are hard-coded into the assistant when it is first constructed, allowing it to provide an asset on up to five non-combat tasks for a PC or other creature that makes use of the assistant automaton. The assistant is suited to staying in one location, but it can travel if asked to do so. However, each full day of travel requires an additional depletion roll.

**Modification**: To modify the assistant to have additional capabilities, add 2 units of responsive synth for each additional capability desired.

**Depletion**: 1 in 1d20 (check per month of use)


<a id="org922e63d"></a>

### Extractor

**Minimum Crafting Level**: 4 **Kind**: Automaton

**Iotum**: Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (16 units); apt clay (4 units); pliable metal (4 units); quantium (3 units) Parts: 44 units

**Specifications**: This plan produces a discshaped automaton about 4 feet (1 m) in diameter that moves up to a short distance each round on a bed of forced air. When released in an area where iotum salvage can be potentially found, the automaton harvests what it can find and extract on its own, providing one additional iotum (up to level 6) per hour that the extractor works in an area that still has salvage. Once it has acquired 5 units of iotum, it returns to a predetermined location and waits to be unpacked. It can return earlier if set to do so.

**Modifications**: To double the iotum the extractor can gather and increase the level of iotum it can gather by 1, a crafter can treat the plan as 1 level higher and add 3 units of smart tissue and 1 unit of psiranium.

**Depletion**: 1 in 1d20 (check per week of use)


<a id="org98fd710"></a>

### Garden Mech

**Minimum Crafting Level**: 2 **Kind**: Automaton

**Iotum**: Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (9 units); apt clay (2 units); pliable metal (4 units)

**Parts**: 20 units

**Specifications**: This plan produces a discshaped limited automaton about 1 foot (30 cm) in diameter. The mech moves on a dozen metallic legs. When released in an area where tended plants are already growing, whether decorative or food crops, the automaton sets to work tending to their needs within an area up to a short range across. It removes pests by hand, aerates the soil, and performs other related tasks, providing an asset to any task attempted by characters to successfully grow plants within that area.

**Depletion**: 1 in 1d20 (check per growing season)


<a id="org800543f"></a>

### Buildnought

**Minimum Crafting Level**: 9

**Kind**: Automaton

**Iotum**: Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (50 units); apt clay (10 units); azure steel (100 units); mimetic gel (20 units); amber crystal (10 units); protomatter (4 units); psiranium (4 units); kaon dot (2 units); monopole (4 units); virtuon particle (10 units); data orb (2 units)

**Parts**: 95 units

**Specifications**: This plan produces a gargantuan automaton about 1,000 feet (300 m) in diameter that moves on hundreds of legs. The automaton’s function is to build cities. Over the course of one year, a buildnought can construct the infrastructure—including walls, homes, structures, and some basic installations—to house a community of 5,000 people. If citizens were to immigrate into the new community, fill it, and take up appropriate roles, the infrastructure and installations already in place would make it a rank 5 community.

A buildnought can be tasked with building specific things, even if plans are not provided to it, because it can take a few months or years to figure out a plan for itself. It takes a buildnought about as long to build any given item or structure as a wright. A buildnought sees to its own iotum needs by building small armies of extractors, which it sends out to salvage from nearby ruins.

**Depletion**: 1 in 1d100 (check per century of building)


<a id="orge790f35"></a>

### Lifting Aventron

**Minimum Crafting Level**: 3 **Kind**: Automaton

**Iotum**: Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (12 units); apt clay (3 units); pliable metal (4 units) Parts: 31 units

**Specifications**: This plan produces a blocky, limited automaton about 3 feet (1 m) on a side with a pair of extendable lift arms. The automaton moves on a dozen metallic legs up to a short distance each round. If commanded, the automaton can move and lift heavy objects, either stacking them in precise piles or unstacking them, as required. Lifting aventrons move too slowly to lift creatures that have the ability to move away from its lifter arms. A lifting aventron can be commanded to stack only certain kinds of objects, to stack different kinds of objects using alternate methods and in different locations, and so on.

**Depletion**: 1 in 1d20 (check per year of use)


<a id="orgeb65df5"></a>

### Mech Soldier, Basic

**Minimum Crafting Level**: 4 **Kind**: Automaton

**Iotum**: Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (19 units); apt clay (4 units); pliable metal (4 units); mimetic gel (2 units)

**Parts**: 42 units

**Specifications**: This plan produces a limited automaton with a humanoid frame whose arms end in metallic blades. The level 4 creature has 1 Armor. The mech soldier has two modes: attack and patrol.

If activated as a character’s action (usually via voice command), the soldier attacks a selected target with its blades until the target flees or is eliminated.

Alternatively, the soldier can be set to patrol an area. It will activate automatically if it comes across creatures not designated as friendly, attacking them until the targets flee or are eliminated.

**Depletion**: 1 in 1d20 (check once after any hour that the mech attacks)


<a id="orgef6689c"></a>

### Storyteller

**Minimum Crafting Level**: 4 **Kind**: Automaton

**Iotum**: Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (23 units); apt clay (4 units); pliable metal (4 units); mimetic gel (2 units); psiranium (2 units)

**Parts**: 41 units

**Specifications**: This plan produces a limited automaton with a humanoid frame about the size of a very small child, but covered with soft fur and with some seskii-like features. The storyteller has two modes: story mode and companion mode.

If activated as a character’s action (usually via voice command), the storyteller spins an entertaining yarn—usually a story that is designed to delight a child, though the storyteller can adapt to its audience.

Alternatively, the storyteller can be set to companion mode where it interacts in an apparently smart but programmatic fashion to a particular person (usually its owner), providing simple feedback, encouragement, and company.

**Depletion**: 1 in 1d20 (check per month of use)
