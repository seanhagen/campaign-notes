This site is for all the resources I'm too lazy to put into World Anvil just yet, as well as stuff that doesn't really belong there anyhow.

For handouts such as secret notes, maps, etc &#x2013; head [here](handouts.md).

To see what Mex is able to build, what she's currently working on, and what materials she's got on hand &#x2013; head [here](mex-shop.md).

For all numenera; cyphers, artefacts, installations, etc &#x2013; head [here](numenera.md).

Lastly, for rulings on rules, homebrew rules, etc &#x2013; head [here](rules.md).
