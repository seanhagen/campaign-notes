## Resources

This is the list of what Mex has on hand to build things with.

Iotum

| Name | Level | Salvage amount | Amount |
|---|---|---|---|
| Io | 1 | 1d6 | 30 |
| Responsive synth | 2 | 1d6 | 20 |
| Apt clay | 3 | 1d6 | 10 |
| Bio-circuitry | 4 | 1d6 | 10 |
| Synthsteel | 4 | 1d6 | 20 |
| Pliable metal | 4 | 1d6 | 5 |
| Azure steel | 5 | 1d6 | 5 |
| Mimetic gel | 5 | 1d6 | 1 |
| Quantium | 5 | 1d6 | 0 |
| Amber crystal | 6 | 1d6 | 3 |
| Protomatter† | 6 | 1 | 0 |
| Thaum dust | 6 | 1d6 | 2 |
| Smart tissue | 7 | 1d6 | 2 |
| Psiranium | 7 | 2 | 1 |
| Kaon dot | 7 | 2 | 0 |
| Monopole | 7 | 2 | 0 |
| Midnight stone | 8 | 2 | 0 |
| Oraculum | 8 | 1 | 0 |
| Virtuon particle | 8 | 1 | 0 |
| Tamed iron | 9 | 1 | 0 |
| Philosophine | 9 | 1 | 0 |
| Data Orb | 9 | 1 | 0 |
| Scalar boson rod | 9 | 1 | 0 |

† Protomatter can’t be salvaged from cyphers, artifacts, automatons or other
objects, scrap, or ruins of the numenera that are smaller than 40 feet (12 m) on
a side because 1 unit of protomatter is almost that massive (unless some sort of
extradimensional space to house the protomatter unit is involved). If this
result occurs in relation to a source that’s too small, thaum dust is salvaged
instead.

## Required Resources

Here's the info on what is required for building artifacts and
cyphers. Installations & automatons list the required iotum & units of parts in
each plan, so they're not listed here.


### Artifacts

**Specifications**: When a crafter has a plan for a specific artifact, they can try
to craft it at that artifact’s minimum crafting level or higher. Use this
template to determine the iotum requirements based on the level of the completed
artifact. The GM may decide that additional iotum is required, depending on the
effect produced.

**Depletion**: 1 in 1d20 or varies

**Parts**: 10 × the level of the completed artifact

| Level | Iotum Required |
|---|---|
| 1 | Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (8 units); synthsteel (2 units) |
| 2 | Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (12 units); synthsteel (2 units) |
| 3 | Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (12 units); synthsteel (4 units); pliable metal (2 units) |
| 4 | Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (12 units); synthsteel (4 units); pliable metal (2 units); amber crystal (1 unit) |
| 5 | Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (12 units); synthsteel (4 units); pliable metal (2 units); amber crystal (4 units) |

### Cyphers

**Specifications**: This plan is a template. When a crafter has a plan for a
specific cypher, they can try to craft it at that cypher’s minimum crafting
level or higher. Use this template to determine the iotum requirements based on
the level of the completed cypher. The GM may decide that additional iotum is
required, depending on the effect produced.

**Depletion**: Cypher

**Parts**: 3 × the level of the completed cypher

| Level | Iotum Required |
|---|---|
| 1 | Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (3 units); quantium (1 unit) |
| 2 | Io (1d6 units); responsive synth (5 units); quantium (1 unit) |

## Full Plans

These are the things Mex has a complete set of plans for, all she needs is
parts. Artifacts & cyphers list the level that Mex can build that item at
without any issues. She can build them at a higher level, but risks failing in
the task and using up the materials without producing anything.

## Partial Plans

Mex has partial plans for these numenera & structures. More plans seeds must be
found for Mex to create a full plan she can use to build from. She doesn't know
what level or how long it'll take, she needs the full plan to figure that out.
